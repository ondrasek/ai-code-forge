# Create Workflow Templates for Native Parallel Execution

## Description
Design standardized workflow patterns that leverage Claude Code's built-in parallelism

## Context
Need systematic templates that show how to effectively use parallel agent clusters in common scenarios.

## Template Examples

### Standard Request Pattern
```
Phase 1 (Parallel): researcher + patterns + principles + completer
Phase 2 (Validation): critic validates all findings simultaneously
Phase 3 (Implementation): docs + whisper (with conflict resolution)
```

### Complex Analysis Pattern
```
Phase 1 (Parallel): researcher + explorer + constraints + patterns + principles
Phase 2 (Parallel): completer + hypothesis + invariants
Phase 3 (Synthesis): resolver + critic
Phase 4 (Cleanup): docs + whisper
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Standard workflow templates created
- [ ] Complex analysis patterns documented
- [ ] Template integration with existing commands
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established

## Notes
Templates should be easily integrated with existing slash commands and agent workflows.
