# Document MCP Memory Server Storage Implementation

## Description
Research and document how the MCP memory server works, where it stores data, and whether storage should be included in repository.

## Research Findings

### How MCP Memory Server Works
- Uses SQLite as storage backend for persistence
- Provides tools for storing, retrieving, searching, and managing memories
- Automatically creates and manages database schema
- Supports semantic search and retrieval capabilities

### Storage Location
- **Database File**: Stores data in configurable SQLite database file
- **Default Location**: Current working directory (configurable)
- **File Names**: `memory.db`, `memories.sqlite`, `project.db`, etc.
- **Additional Files**: SQLite WAL/SHM files for transaction management

### Repository Inclusion Decision
**SHOULD BE GITIGNORED** for these reasons:
- **Privacy**: Memory may contain sensitive user information
- **Size**: Database files can grow large over time
- **User-Specific**: Memories are typically instance-specific
- **Binary Format**: SQLite files don't diff well in version control

## Implementation Completed

### Updated .gitignore
Added comprehensive MCP memory server exclusions:
```gitignore
# MCP Memory Server Data (should not be versioned)
memory.db
memory.sqlite
memories.db
project.db
*.db-wal
*.db-shm
mcp-memory/
.mcp-memory/
```

### Best Practices Documented
- Use environment variables for database path configuration
- Separate database files for different environments
- Implement backup strategies for important memory data
- Restrict file permissions on memory database files
- Monitor database growth and implement cleanup strategies

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Researched MCP memory server implementation
- [x] Identified storage location and mechanism
- [x] Determined repository inclusion policy
- [x] Updated .gitignore with appropriate exclusions
- [x] Documented best practices for deployment

## Notes
Memory database files should remain local to each Claude Code instance and not be shared via version control. Each user/environment will build their own memory over time.
