# Monitoring Metrics - Ecosystem Health

## Description
Implement comprehensive monitoring and metrics collection for optimized agent ecosystem to track performance, utilization, and health over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create agent utilization metrics (frequency, duration, success rate)
- [ ] Implement performance tracking (response times, context overhead)
- [ ] Monitor parallel execution efficiency and bottlenecks
- [ ] Track user satisfaction and task completion rates
- [ ] Create alerting for agent ecosystem anomalies
- [ ] Implement trend analysis for continuous optimization
- [ ] Create dashboards for ecosystem health visualization
- [ ] Monitor context pollution metrics and reduction progress
- [ ] Track agent selection accuracy and optimization effectiveness

## Notes
Monitoring categories:
1. **Performance Metrics**: Response time, throughput, resource usage
2. **Utilization Metrics**: Agent selection frequency, parallel execution patterns
3. **Quality Metrics**: Task completion success, user satisfaction scores
4. **Health Metrics**: Error rates, timeout frequency, system stability
5. **Optimization Metrics**: Improvement trends, efficiency gains

**Key Performance Indicators**:
- Average task completion time
- Agent selection accuracy rate
- Context pollution reduction percentage
- Parallel execution efficiency
- User satisfaction scores
- System stability metrics

**Monitoring Infrastructure**:
- Real-time metrics collection
- Historical trend analysis
- Automated alerting for regressions
- Performance baseline establishment
- Continuous optimization feedback loop
