We shall have an opportunistic-researcher agent (may be rename the existing researcher?) to automaticaly look into online documentation and look for community resources as a bare minimum. It should not disregard any other sources of course.

We can have another one - academic-researcher that would focus on academic papers, etc.

We can take advantage of perplexity MCP server as well.
