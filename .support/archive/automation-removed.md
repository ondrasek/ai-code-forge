# Automation Infrastructure Removal Log

## Removed Components (v2.51.0)

### Installation Scripts Removed
- `.support/scripts/install.sh` - Main dotfiles installer that:
  - Installed Claude Code via npm globally
  - Created symlinks for .claude configuration
  - Added shell aliases (cc, claude-init, etc.)
  - Installed MCP tools and uv for Python
  - Configured Git aliases for Claude-powered commits
  
- `.support/scripts/install-launch-claude.sh` - Shell alias installer that:
  - Added launch-claude alias to shell configurations
  - Configured enhanced Claude Code wrapper
  
- `.support/scripts/validate-template.sh` - Template validation that:
  - Checked directory structure completeness
  - Verified all commands and agents were present
  - Validated MCP configurations

### DevContainer Retained
- `.devcontainer/` directory - KEPT for development environment setup:
  - Provides DevContainer configuration for local development
  - Replicates GitHub Codespace environment
  - Manages secure environment variable inheritance
  - Includes enterprise-grade secret management

## Preserved Configuration Examples
All valuable configuration examples remain in:
- `.claude/` - Complete Claude Code configuration
- `.support/` - Prompts, instructions, MCP servers, stacks
- `docs/` - Documentation and usage guides

## Migration to Manual Configuration
Users should now manually copy desired configuration files to their own projects rather than using automated installation scripts.
