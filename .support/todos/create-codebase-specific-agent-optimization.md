# Create Codebase-Specific Agent Optimization System

## Description
Develop command system to analyze codebase and generate optimized, targeted agents

## Context
Current agents are generic. We need a system to analyze this specific codebase and create specialized agents that are more efficient for this project's patterns and needs.

## Implementation Details
1. Command triggers existing agents to analyze codebase
2. Use analysis to design AI-optimized, efficient, targeted Claude Code sub-agents for this specific codebase
3. Propose sub-agent definitions and store them in .claude/agents folder
4. Remove existing generic sub-agents if there is overlap
5. Keep new, specific agents for better performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Codebase analysis command implemented
- [ ] Agent optimization algorithm created
- [ ] Automatic agent generation system built
- [ ] Generic agent replacement workflow established
- [ ] Changes properly documented in CHANGELOG.md

## Notes
This can be implemented as one command or multiple commands, whichever works better. The goal is to replace generic agents with codebase-specific ones that understand this project's patterns.
