# Track Context Pollution Reduction

## Description
Measure and analyze improvements in keeping the main context window clean and focused by tracking context pollution metrics before and after agent audit implementation. This will quantify the effectiveness of delegating complex analysis to agent contexts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define measurable metrics for context pollution (message length, topic drift, noise ratio)
- [ ] Establish baseline measurements of current context pollution levels
- [ ] Implement tracking mechanisms for context cleanliness metrics
- [ ] Measure reduction in main context verbosity after agent delegation
- [ ] Track frequency of off-topic or verbose responses in main context
- [ ] Monitor user satisfaction with context clarity and focus
- [ ] Generate before/after comparisons showing improvement
- [ ] Create automated alerts for context pollution regression

## Measurement Framework
- **Message Length**: Average tokens per response in main context
- **Topic Focus**: Percentage of responses directly addressing user query
- **Noise Ratio**: Proportion of unnecessary detail or tangential information
- **Agent Delegation Rate**: Frequency of successfully delegating complex analysis
- **Context Efficiency**: Ratio of useful information to total context length
- **User Engagement**: Time to user follow-up questions (shorter = clearer responses)

## Implementation Strategy
- Implement automated analysis of conversation transcripts
- Compare context metrics before and after agent audit changes
- Track patterns in when context stays clean vs. becomes polluted
- Identify specific triggers that lead to context pollution
- Measure correlation between agent usage and context cleanliness

## Success Targets
- 30% reduction in average main context response length
- 50% increase in topic focus score
- 40% reduction in noise ratio
- 80% increase in agent delegation for complex analysis
- Measurable improvement in user satisfaction with clarity

## Notes
This is a critical metric for validating the agent audit implementation. Clean context is essential for user experience and system efficiency. The tracking should be comprehensive but not intrusive to normal operations.
