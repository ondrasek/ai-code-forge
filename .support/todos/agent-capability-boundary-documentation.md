# Agent Capability Boundary Documentation

## Description
Document clear capability boundaries and interaction protocols for optimized agent ecosystem to prevent overlap and ensure proper agent selection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define precise capability boundaries for each consolidated agent
- [ ] Document interaction protocols between foundation and specialist agents
- [ ] Create decision trees for agent selection based on task characteristics
- [ ] Define escalation paths when multiple agents could handle a task
- [ ] Document capability inheritance patterns from foundation to specialist agents
- [ ] Create capability matrix showing agent strengths and limitations
- [ ] Define anti-patterns and when NOT to use specific agents
- [ ] Document agent collaboration patterns for complex multi-domain tasks

## Notes
Boundary documentation should address:
1. **Primary Responsibilities**: Core capabilities each agent owns
2. **Secondary Capabilities**: Supporting functions agents can perform
3. **Exclusion Zones**: Tasks agents should never handle
4. **Collaboration Points**: Where agents should work together
5. **Escalation Triggers**: When to invoke additional agents

**Documentation Locations**:
- Individual agent definitions in `.claude/agents/`
- Consolidated overview in CLAUDE.md
- Decision trees in `.support/instructions/`
- Capability matrix in agent documentation
