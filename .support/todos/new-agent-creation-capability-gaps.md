# New Agent Creation - Capability Gaps

## Description
Create new agents to fill identified capability gaps that emerged during comprehensive agent analysis. Focus on missing critical capabilities not covered by current agent ecosystem.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create specialist-security for security analysis and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Create specialist-database for database design, optimization, and schema management
- [ ] Create specialist-api for API design, documentation, and integration patterns
- [ ] Create specialist-deployment for infrastructure, CI/CD, and deployment strategies
- [ ] Create specialist-monitoring for logging, metrics, and observability
- [ ] Create specialist-migration for data migration and schema evolution
- [ ] Each new agent must have clear, non-overlapping responsibilities
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md parallel coordination patterns to include new agents
- [ ] Define interaction protocols with existing foundation agents

## Notes
Gap analysis revealed missing coverage in:
- Security and vulnerability assessment
- Database design and optimization
- API design and integration
- Deployment and infrastructure
- System monitoring and observability
- Data migration strategies

New agents should integrate seamlessly with existing foundation agent architecture while providing specialized expertise in underserved domains.
