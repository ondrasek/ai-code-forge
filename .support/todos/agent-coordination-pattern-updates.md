# Agent Coordination Pattern Updates

## Description
Update CLAUDE.md coordination patterns and parallel execution rules to reflect optimized agent ecosystem after consolidation and new agent creation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update parallel agent count recommendations (4-6 agents per task)
- [ ] Revise agent combination patterns for common task types
- [ ] Update automatic agent escalation rules
- [ ] Define new core-satellite coordination patterns
- [ ] Update mandatory parallel execution patterns
- [ ] Revise conflict resolution protocols with consolidated agents
- [ ] Update agent hierarchy and spawning rules
- [ ] Create new task complexity to agent count mappings
- [ ] Document interaction patterns between foundation and consolidated specialist agents

## Notes
Key updates needed:
1. **Parallel Patterns**: Adjust agent counts based on consolidated ecosystem
2. **Selection Logic**: Update automatic agent selection for common tasks
3. **Coordination Rules**: Revise inter-agent communication protocols
4. **Escalation Triggers**: Update conditions for adding additional agents
5. **Foundation Integration**: Ensure consolidated specialists work with foundation agents

**Critical Sections to Update**:
- AGGRESSIVE PARALLEL AGENT USAGE PATTERNS
- TASK COMPLEXITY â†’ AGENT COUNT MAPPING
- AUTOMATIC AGENT ESCALATION RULES
- PARALLEL CLUSTER COMPOSITION RULES
- ENHANCED EXECUTION PROTOCOL
