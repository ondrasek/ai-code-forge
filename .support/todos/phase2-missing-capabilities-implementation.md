# Phase 2: Missing Capabilities Implementation

## Description
Implement critical missing capabilities identified in ecosystem analysis: DevOps automation, system monitoring, and business context understanding.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create devops-automation agent for CI/CD, deployment, and infrastructure
- [ ] Implement monitoring agent for system health and performance tracking
- [ ] Add business-context agent for requirements analysis and user impact
- [ ] Create security-audit agent for vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Implement performance-profiler agent for optimization analysis
- [ ] Add compliance-checker agent for regulatory and standards validation
- [ ] Update agent combination patterns to include new agents
- [ ] Test new agents with real-world scenarios

## New Agent Specifications

### DevOps Automation Agent
- **Purpose**: Infrastructure, deployment, and CI/CD management
- **Triggers**: Docker files, CI configs, deployment issues
- **Capabilities**: Infrastructure as code, deployment strategies, monitoring setup

### System Monitoring Agent
- **Purpose**: Performance tracking and system health analysis
- **Triggers**: Performance issues, resource constraints, scaling needs
- **Capabilities**: Metrics analysis, alerting setup, capacity planning

### Business Context Agent
- **Purpose**: Requirements analysis and business impact assessment
- **Triggers**: Feature requests, user feedback, business decisions
- **Capabilities**: Stakeholder analysis, impact assessment, requirement validation

### Security Audit Agent
- **Purpose**: Security vulnerability assessment and compliance
- **Triggers**: Security reviews, vulnerability reports, compliance checks
- **Capabilities**: Code security analysis, dependency auditing, compliance validation

### Performance Profiler Agent
- **Purpose**: Performance optimization and bottleneck identification
- **Triggers**: Performance complaints, resource issues, optimization requests
- **Capabilities**: Performance profiling, optimization recommendations, resource analysis

### Compliance Checker Agent
- **Purpose**: Regulatory and standards compliance validation
- **Triggers**: Compliance reviews, audit preparations, regulatory changes
- **Capabilities**: Standards checking, audit trail generation, compliance reporting

## Integration Points
- Update ecosystem-analyzer to include new agents in analysis
- Modify agent combination patterns for comprehensive coverage
- Integrate with existing core agents for seamless workflows

## Success Metrics
- Coverage gap reduced from 40% to <10%
- Business alignment improved by 60%
- Security posture enhanced by 75%
- Operational efficiency increased by 50%

## Notes
These agents address the most critical gaps identified in the ecosystem analysis. Priority should be given to devops-automation and monitoring agents for immediate operational impact.
