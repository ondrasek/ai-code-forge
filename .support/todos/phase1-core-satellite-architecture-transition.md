# Phase 1: Core-Satellite Architecture Transition

## Description
Implement the core-satellite architecture transition from 29 agents to optimized 6 core + 12 specialized agents structure based on ecosystem analysis findings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify and designate 6 core agents (researcher, patterns, principles, critic, context, resolver)
- [ ] Restructure 12 specialized agents for domain-specific tasks
- [ ] Archive or merge 11 redundant agents based on usage analysis
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md agent combination patterns for new structure
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring for 35-45% improvement validation
- [ ] Test all existing workflows with new architecture

## Implementation Details

### Core Agents (Always Available)
- **researcher**: Information gathering and analysis
- **patterns**: Code pattern detection and application
- **principles**: Best practice enforcement
- **critic**: Quality validation and review
- **context**: System understanding and documentation
- **resolver**: Conflict resolution and decision making

### Specialized Agents (Context-Triggered)
- **explorer**: Alternative generation for architecture decisions
- **hypothesis**: Theory formation for debugging
- **whisper**: Code improvement suggestions
- **completer**: Completeness validation
- **docs**: Documentation maintenance
- **constraints**: Requirement and limitation handling

### Agents to Archive/Merge
- Identify low-usage agents from usage frequency analysis
- Merge overlapping capabilities (e.g., similar analysis agents)
- Archive agents with <5% usage in real workflows

## Success Metrics
- Agent selection time reduced by 40%
- Context pollution decreased by 35%
- Task completion efficiency improved by 45%
- Workflow complexity reduced while maintaining quality

## Notes
This is the foundation for all subsequent ecosystem optimizations. Must be completed before Phase 2 implementations.
