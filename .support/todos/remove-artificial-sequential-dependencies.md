# Remove Artificial Sequential Dependencies

## Description
Identify and eliminate unnecessary sequential chains where agents could run in parallel

## Context
Individual `critic` calls in agent definitions create sequential bottlenecks and linear "flow" descriptions prevent parallel thinking.

## Current Issues
- Individual `critic` calls in agent definitions create sequential bottlenecks
- Linear "flow" descriptions prevent parallel thinking
- Excessive self-criticism dependencies create artificial delays

## Proposed Changes
- Replace sequential `critic` calls with batch validation
- Cluster independent analysis agents together
- Enable parallel self-criticism sessions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Agent definitions reviewed for unnecessary sequential calls
- [ ] Batch validation patterns implemented
- [ ] Parallel cluster workflows enabled
- [ ] Performance improvements measured

## Notes
Focus on maintaining agent independence while enabling parallel execution.
