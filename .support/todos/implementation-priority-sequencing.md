# Implementation Priority Sequencing

## Description
Define implementation sequence and priority ordering for all agent review recommendations to ensure smooth transition and minimal disruption to existing workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Phase 1: Critical agent consolidations (highest overlap agents)
- [ ] Phase 2: Performance optimizations (caching, selection algorithms)
- [ ] Phase 3: Redundant agent removal (after consolidation proves successful)
- [ ] Phase 4: Advanced optimization (pipelines, monitoring)
- [ ] Define rollback strategies for each phase
- [ ] Create validation checkpoints between phases
- [ ] Establish success metrics for each implementation phase
- [ ] Document dependencies between different optimization tasks

## Notes
Implementation priority based on:
1. **Risk/Impact Assessment**: Low-risk, high-impact changes first
2. **Dependency Management**: Prerequisites before dependent changes
3. **Validation Opportunities**: Frequent checkpoints to verify improvements
4. **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert changes if issues arise

**Phase Dependencies**:
- Consolidation must complete before removal
- Performance optimization independent of structural changes
- NO NEW AGENT CREATION (command specialization preferred)
- Monitoring implementation throughout all phases

**Success Metrics**:
- Agent response time improvement: >30%
- Context pollution reduction: >50%
- User satisfaction maintenance: 100%
- System stability: Zero regressions
