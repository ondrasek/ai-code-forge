# Performance Optimization - Agent Efficiency

## Description
Implement performance optimizations identified during specialist agent review to improve response times, reduce context pollution, and enhance parallel execution efficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Optimize agent selection algorithms to reduce decision overhead
- [ ] Implement agent result caching to avoid redundant analysis
- [ ] Create agent execution pipelines for common task patterns
- [ ] Optimize inter-agent communication protocols
- [ ] Reduce context switching overhead between agents
- [ ] Implement smart agent dependency resolution
- [ ] Create performance monitoring for agent execution times
- [ ] Establish performance benchmarks and SLA targets
- [ ] Optimize parallel agent coordination patterns

## Notes
Performance optimization priorities:
1. Agent selection speed - reduce decision time by 50%
2. Result caching - avoid redundant analysis on similar tasks
3. Pipeline optimization - streamline common agent execution patterns
4. Context management - minimize context pollution during agent coordination
5. Dependency resolution - smart sequencing of dependent agent tasks

Target: 40% improvement in overall agent system performance while maintaining quality.
