# Simplify TODO Management System

## Description
Replace the overly complex TODO management system with a simple folder-based approach using only Claude Code built-in tools.

## Context
- Original system had Python scripts, CLI wrappers, and complex automation
- User requested simpler approach using individual markdown files
- Should leverage Claude Code's native tools (Glob, Read, Write, Edit)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Remove complex Python scripts and CLI tools
- [x] Create simple todos/ folder structure
- [x] Update /todo command to use built-in tools only
- [x] Restore user's original TODO.md content
- [x] Create example TODO file demonstrating format

## Implementation Notes
- Each TODO is a separate markdown file with YAML frontmatter
- Use Glob tool to list TODOs, Read tool to view, Edit tool to update
- No external dependencies or complex automation scripts
- Focus on simplicity and maintainability

## Outcome
Successfully simplified the system and restored the user's important notes that were accidentally overwritten.
