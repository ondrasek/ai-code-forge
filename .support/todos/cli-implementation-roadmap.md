## Development Dependencies

### Critical Path Analysis:
```
Core Infrastructure → Essential Commands → Version Management
                  ↓
              Advanced Features → User Experience → Extended Functionality
```

### Parallel Development Opportunities:
- **Core Infrastructure + Essential Commands**: Can be developed simultaneously by different developers
- **troubleshoot + agent-ecosystem**: Independent command implementations
- **Security + Performance**: Can be added incrementally without breaking changes

### Blocking Relationships:
- **Version Management** requires **Essential Commands** for rollback capabilities  
- **Advanced Features** require **Essential Commands** for baseline functionality
- **Extended Functionality** requires stable **User Experience** foundation
