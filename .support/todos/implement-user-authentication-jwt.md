# Implement User Authentication System with JWT Tokens

## Description
Develop a comprehensive user authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user session management and API access control.

## Requirements
- User registration and login endpoints
- JWT token generation and validation
- Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
- Token refresh mechanism
- Authentication middleware
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure token storage best practices

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can register with email and password
- [ ] User can login with valid credentials
- [ ] JWT tokens are generated with appropriate expiration
- [ ] Protected routes require valid JWT authentication
- [ ] Token refresh functionality works correctly
- [ ] Passwords are securely hashed and stored
- [ ] Authentication middleware protects API endpoints
- [ ] Role-based permissions are enforced
- [ ] Security best practices are followed

## Technical Considerations
- Choose appropriate JWT library for the tech stack
- Implement secure token storage (httpOnly cookies vs localStorage)
- Set up proper CORS configuration
- Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add logging for security events

## Dependencies
- Depends on database setup and user model
- May require environment configuration for JWT secrets
- Frontend integration needed for complete flow

## Estimated Effort
Medium to Large - involves multiple components and security considerations
