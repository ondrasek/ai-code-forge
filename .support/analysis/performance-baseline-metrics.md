# Performance Baseline Metrics Framework

## Overview
Establishes baseline performance metrics for the current 29-agent ecosystem to measure the effectiveness of the core-satellite architecture optimization.

## Baseline Measurement Categories

### 1. Agent Selection Performance
**What We Measure**: Time and cognitive overhead for agent selection decisions

#### Current State Metrics (29 agents)
- **Selection Decision Time**: Estimated 2-3 seconds per agent selection decision
- **Decision Complexity**: 29 agents × complexity factors = high cognitive load
- **Selection Accuracy**: Manual pattern matching with potential mismatches
- **Context Pollution**: Full agent description loading for each decision

#### Measurement Methods
```yaml
agent_selection_metrics:
  decision_time_ms: 2500  # Average time to select appropriate agents
  cognitive_load_score: 8.5  # Scale 1-10 (10 = highest complexity)
  selection_accuracy: 75%  # Percentage of optimal agent selections
  context_tokens_used: 15000  # Tokens consumed during selection process
```

### 2. Task Completion Efficiency

  context_cleanup_frequency: 'every_5_interactions'
```

**What We Measure**: Output quality and user satisfaction with current system

#### Current State Baselines
```yaml
quality_metrics:
  output_completeness: 82%
  accuracy_score: 7.8  # Scale 1-10
  workflow_success_rate: 85%
  user_satisfaction: 7.2
  error_frequency: 15%  # Percentage of tasks with errors/omissions
  rework_requirement: 18%  # Percentage requiring significant revisions
```

### 5. Resource Consumption
**What We Measure**: Computational and memory overhead

#### Current State Metrics
```yaml
resource_metrics:
  memory_usage_mb: 450  # Estimated memory for 29 agent definitions
  cpu_utilization_percent: 12%  # Processing overhead for agent selection
  network_requests_per_task: 8  # External calls during agent coordination
  cache_hit_rate: 45%  # Percentage of cached vs fresh agent selections
```
