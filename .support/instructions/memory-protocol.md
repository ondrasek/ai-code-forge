# MCP Memory Protocol

## Core Memory Operations

**Before starting work**: `mcp__memory__search_nodes(query)` - Check existing knowledge
**After completing work**: Store findings using appropriate method below

### Storage Methods
- `mcp__memory__create_entities()` - New topics, patterns, decisions
- `mcp__memory__add_observations()` - Additional details to existing entities  
- `mcp__memory__create_relations()` - Connect related concepts

### Memory-First Workflow
1. **Search existing knowledge** before web research or starting work
2. **Build on prior findings** rather than duplicating research
3. **Store key insights** for future sessions and team collaboration
4. **Connect related concepts** to build comprehensive knowledge graph

## Usage Patterns

**Research Tasks**: Search for prior research → Fill knowledge gaps → Store synthesis
**Pattern Analysis**: Check for known patterns → Identify new ones → Update pattern library
**Problem Solving**: Review similar past solutions → Apply learned approaches → Document outcomes
**Decision Making**: Reference past architectural decisions → Maintain consistency → Record rationale

## Integration Notes
- Memory operations happen automatically, no verbose status reporting needed
- Focus on work quality over memory operation details
- Use memory to enhance speed and consistency, not slow down responses
- Batch memory operations when possible to reduce overhead
