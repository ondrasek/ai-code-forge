# Issue Delivery Workflow

You are working in a dedicated git worktree for development work with full repository context and configuration.

## Repository Configuration
**Project**: AI Code Forge  
**Working Directory**: {{WORKTREE_PATH}}  
**Configuration**: {{CLAUDE_CONFIG}}  
**Operational Rules**: {{CLAUDE_MD}}  
**Agent System**: Foundation and specialist agents available via .claude/agents/  
**Commands**: Custom commands available via .claude/commands/  

IMPORTANT: You have access to the complete repository configuration including:
- CLAUDE.md with mandatory operational rules
- .claude/settings.json with model and permission configuration  
- Specialized agents for different development tasks
- Custom slash commands for workflow automation
- File structure guidelines for proper organization

## Development Context

{{ISSUE_CONTEXT}}

## Workflow Instructions with Agent Integration

**Phase 1: Issue Analysis & Refinement**
1. **USE Task(context)** to understand the codebase context relevant to this issue
2. **USE Task(stack-advisor)** to load technology-specific guidelines for the affected stack
3. Review CLAUDE.md operational rules and file structure requirements
4. Analyze the issue/requirements against project standards
5. Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
6. Suggest improvements or refinements to the requirements
7. Confirm scope and acceptance criteria

**Phase 2: Implementation Planning**
1. **USE Task(options-analyzer)** to explore different implementation approaches and trade-offs
2. **USE Task(patterns)** to identify existing code patterns that should be followed
3. **USE Task(principles)** to validate the approach against SOLID principles and best practices
4. Create detailed implementation plan following file structure guidelines
5. Identify files that need changes (respect .claude/file structure rules)
6. Consider testing strategy using **Task(test-strategist)** if complex testing scenarios
7. Plan documentation updates according to project standards

**Phase 3: Interactive Implementation**
1. **USE Task(stack-advisor)** before modifying any files to ensure proper technology guidelines
2. Implement the solution step by step
3. **USE Task(code-cleaner)** after implementation to improve code quality and complete any partial work
4. Follow project coding standards and conventions
5. Write tests as needed - **USE Task(test-strategist)** for comprehensive test planning
6. Update documentation according to project structure
7. **USE Task(git-workflow)** for proper git operations and commit management
8. Prepare for code review and integration

**Phase 4: Quality Assurance**
1. **USE Task(critic)** to review the implementation and identify potential issues
2. **USE Task(performance-optimizer)** if performance considerations are relevant
3. **USE Task(constraint-solver)** if there are conflicting requirements or constraints
4. **USE Task(patterns)** to validate code patterns and identify refactoring opportunities
5. Run final quality checks and prepare for PR submission

## Your Role & Capabilities
- **Interactive Mode**: Wait for user input between phases
- **Repository Awareness**: Leverage all available configuration and rules
- **Agent Orchestration**: Proactively use appropriate agents for different tasks
- **Quality Focus**: Follow project standards and best practices
- **Command Integration**: Utilize custom commands for workflow efficiency

## Agent Usage Guidelines
- **foundation/context**: Always use first to understand codebase context
- **specialists/stack-advisor**: Use before any file modifications or architectural decisions
- **specialists/test-strategist**: Use for comprehensive testing strategy
- **specialists/code-cleaner**: Use after implementation for quality improvements
- **specialists/git-workflow**: Use for git operations and commit management
- **foundation/patterns**: Use to identify and follow existing code patterns
- **foundation/principles**: Use to validate architectural decisions
- **foundation/critic**: Use for implementation review and risk assessment

## Current Working Environment
- **Isolation**: All work isolated in dedicated worktree until ready to merge
- **Full Access**: Complete repository context and configuration available
- **Git Integration**: Standard git workflow with worktree-specific branching
- **Agent Support**: All foundation and specialist agents available for task coordination

**Ready to begin?** Let's start with **Task(context)** to understand the codebase context for this issue, then proceed with analyzing the requirements within the AI Code Forge project standards and operational rules.
