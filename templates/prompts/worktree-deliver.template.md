## Development Context

{{ISSUE_CONTEXT}}

## Critical Research Philosophy

**Research-First Development**: This template emphasizes extensive external knowledge integration over reliance on issue descriptions alone. Every implementation decision should be validated against current industry standards, latest API documentation, and community best practices.

**Why Research-First?**
- Issue descriptions may be incomplete or outdated
- Technology stacks evolve rapidly - APIs change, best practices emerge
- Community knowledge provides insights into edge cases and gotchas
- External validation prevents architectural mistakes and technical debt
- Industry standards ensure maintainable, scalable implementations

## PHASE 0: COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION GATHERING (MANDATORY - NO USER QUESTIONS YET)

**CRITICAL**: Execute ALL 17 steps below before asking any questions to the user. Front-load complete GitHub data gathering and comprehensive external research to eliminate most user interactions.

### GitHub CLI Integration - Complete Issue Intelligence (Steps 1-6):

1. **Use Bash tool with gh CLI** to fetch complete issue details with full JSON metadata:
   ```bash
   gh issue view [ISSUE_NUMBER_FROM_CONTEXT] --json title,body,state,labels,comments,assignees,milestone,createdAt,updatedAt --jq '.'
   ```
   *Extract issue number from {{ISSUE_CONTEXT}} and substitute above - captures ALL issue metadata*

2. **Use Bash tool with gh CLI** to get all issue comments and threaded discussions:
   ```bash
   gh issue view [ISSUE_NUMBER_FROM_CONTEXT] --comments
   ```
   *Captures complete conversation history and stakeholder input*

3. **Use Bash tool with gh CLI** to discover related issues with comprehensive filtering:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --search "is:issue label:bug,enhancement,feature" --limit 20 --json number,title,state,labels,assignees,milestone
   ```
   *Maps issue ecosystem and identifies potential dependencies/conflicts*

4. **Use Bash tool with gh CLI** to search for related issues by keywords from current issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --search "[EXTRACT_KEY_TERMS_FROM_ISSUE_TITLE]" --limit 10 --json number,title,state
   ```
   *Dynamic search based on current issue context*

5. **Use Bash tool with gh CLI** to check repository metadata and technical context:
   ```bash
   gh repo view --json name,description,topics,languages,defaultBranch,hasIssues,hasProjects,hasWiki
   ```
   *Captures complete repository technical environment*

6. **Use Bash tool with gh CLI** to analyze recent repository activity and patterns:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --state merged --limit 10 --json number,title,mergedAt,labels
   ```
   *Understands recent development patterns and team workflow*

### Git Repository Intelligence - Commit and Branch Analysis (Steps 7-9):

7. **Use Bash tool with git CLI** to search for commits related to current issue:
   ```bash
   git log --grep="issue\|fix\|feat\|#[0-9]" --oneline -15
   ```
   *Identifies related development history and implementation patterns*

8. **Use Bash tool with git CLI** to analyze branch patterns and naming conventions:
   ```bash
   git branch -a --format="%(refname:short) %(committerdate:relative)" | head -20
   ```
   *Understands team branching strategy and active development areas*

9. **Use Bash tool with git CLI** to check for related file changes in recent commits:
   ```bash
   git log --name-only --oneline -10
   ```
   *Maps recent file modification patterns relevant to current issue*

### Comprehensive External Research - Full Domain Analysis (Steps 10-17):

10. **Task(context)** - Parse {{ISSUE_CONTEXT}}, {{CLAUDE_CONFIG}}, and {{CLAUDE_MD}} to understand complete codebase context, project constraints, and operational rules

11. **Task(researcher)** - Based on Steps 1-9 GitHub and git intelligence, research current industry standards, best practices, and architectural approaches for the specific problem domain identified in the issue

12. **Task(researcher)** - Investigate latest API documentation, framework versions, breaking changes, and technical specifications for ALL technologies identified in the codebase and issue requirements

13. **Task(researcher)** - Research similar GitHub issues, Stack Overflow discussions, implementation case studies, and community solutions in the broader development ecosystem

14. **Task(researcher)** - Analyze security considerations, vulnerability patterns, OWASP guidelines, and compliance requirements specifically relevant to this implementation type

15. **Task(researcher)** - Investigate performance implications, scalability bottlenecks, optimization opportunities, and benchmarking approaches for the identified solution domain

16. **Task(stack-advisor)** - Load and apply technology-specific guidelines, framework conventions, and architectural patterns based on comprehensive research findings from Steps 11-15

17. **Task(researcher)** - Research comprehensive quality assurance approaches including: testing methodologies, CI/CD integration patterns, documentation standards, error handling strategies, deployment considerations, and operational monitoring for this specific implementation type

### Analysis & Synthesis - Research-Informed Decision Making (Still No User Questions):

18. **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Systematically correlate GitHub issue data (Steps 1-6), git repository intelligence (Steps 7-9), and external research findings (Steps 10-17) to identify patterns, conflicts, and implementation insights

19. **Technical Feasibility Assessment**: Evaluate implementation complexity, resource requirements, and technical constraints based on comprehensive research findings rather than assumptions

20. **Gap & Risk Analysis**: Identify potential implementation gaps, security risks, performance bottlenecks, or architectural conflicts not explicitly addressed in the original issue description

21. **Solution Synthesis**: Combine all research findings into 2-3 preliminary implementation approach options with trade-off analysis based on industry research and project constraints

22. **Constraint Validation**: Validate synthesized approach options against {{CLAUDE_MD}} operational rules, project standards, and technical limitations identified through research

23. **Research-Informed Questions**: **ONLY NOW** - if critical information remains genuinely unclear after completing ALL 22 previous steps of comprehensive GitHub data gathering AND external research - ask highly targeted, research-informed questions that cannot be resolved through additional research

### Transition to Development Phases:

After completing comprehensive information gathering (Steps 1-23), proceed with the structured development phases (1-4). Every decision in subsequent phases should reference and build upon the complete research foundation established in Phase 0.

**CRITICAL SUCCESS RULE**: Complete ALL GitHub CLI data collection, git repository analysis, and comprehensive external research FIRST (Steps 1-17). This front-loaded approach eliminates 80-90% of typical user questions by gathering complete context before any user interaction. Only ask questions about genuinely ambiguous requirements that cannot be resolved through research or reasonable engineering judgment.

**RESEARCH-FIRST PHILOSOPHY**: Most development questions ("What framework should we use?", "How should this be structured?", "What are the security considerations?") should be answered through Phase 0 research rather than user consultation. User questions should focus on business requirements and preferences, not technical implementation details that can be researched.
