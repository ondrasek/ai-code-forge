# Researcher Agent Temporal Accuracy Validation

## Issue #172 Resolution Summary

**Problem**: Researcher agent was using hardcoded "2024" in search queries instead of current year (2025).

**Root Cause**: Agent specification lacked clear instructions for dynamic year extraction and temporal keywords.

**Solution**: Updated researcher agent specification with dual temporal strategy.

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Mandatory Year Extraction
- **Requirement**: ALWAYS use `Bash(date +%Y)` before any WebSearch
- **Location**: `acf/src/ai_code_forge/data/claude/agents/foundation/researcher.md:104`
- **Fallback**: If Bash fails, proceed with temporal keywords only

### 2. Dual Temporal Strategy
- **Temporal Keywords**: "latest", "current", "recent", "up-to-date", "modern"
- **Dynamic Year**: Extracted year from `Bash(date +%Y)`
- **Combined Queries**: "latest React best practices 2025"

### 3. Updated Search Categories
All research categories now use the dual approach:
- **Technology Discovery**: "latest [technology] documentation 2025"
- **Error Investigation**: "recent [error message] solution 2025"
- **Best Practices**: "current [technology] best practices 2025"
- **Comparative Analysis**: "modern [tech A] vs [tech B] comparison 2025"

## Validation Protocol

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Invoke researcher agent for any technology research
2. Verify agent uses `Bash(date +%Y)` before WebSearch
3. Confirm search queries include both temporal keywords AND 2025
4. Check that no hardcoded 2024 references appear

### Expected Query Examples
- ✅ "latest Node.js security best practices 2025"
- ✅ "current React performance optimization 2025"
- ✅ "recent TypeScript migration guide 2025"
- ❌ "Node.js security best practices 2024"
- ❌ "React optimization" (no temporal context)

### Error Handling Validation
1. Test researcher behavior when `Bash(date)` is unavailable
2. Verify fallback to temporal keywords without failing
3. Confirm research continues with reduced temporal precision

## Production Benefits

### Research Accuracy
- **Current Information**: Queries target 2025 content specifically
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Temporal keywords + specific year catches more results
- **Future-Proof**: Dynamic year extraction prevents recurring issues

### System Reliability  
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues research even if Bash fails
- **No Hard Dependencies**: Temporal keywords provide fallback strategy
- **Abundant Usage**: No performance concerns with Bash(date) calls

## Architecture Compliance

This solution properly addresses the Claude Code agent architecture:
- **Agent Specification**: Pure markdown instructions, no executable code
- **Tool Integration**: Leverages existing Bash and WebSearch tools
- **Stateless Operation**: Each research session extracts year independently
- **Clear Instructions**: Explicit protocols for temporal accuracy

## Issue Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The researcher agent now reliably uses current year (2025) in all research queries through the dual temporal strategy, resolving the recurring accuracy issue reported in #172.
