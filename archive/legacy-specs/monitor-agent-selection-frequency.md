# Monitor Agent Selection Frequency

## Description
Implement monitoring and analytics to track which agents are being selected and how frequently they are used. This will provide insights into agent utilization patterns and help identify underutilized or overutilized agents in the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create logging mechanism to track agent selection events
- [ ] Record agent selection timestamps, context, and usage patterns
- [ ] Implement frequency analysis for each agent type
- [ ] Generate reports showing agent utilization statistics
- [ ] Identify agents that are never or rarely selected
- [ ] Track agent combination patterns and their success rates
- [ ] Create dashboard or summary view of agent selection metrics
- [ ] Implement alerts for unusual agent selection patterns

## Implementation Details
- Track agent invocations with metadata (timestamp, context type, success/failure)
- Store selection data in structured format for analysis
- Calculate selection frequency per agent over time periods
- Identify patterns in agent combinations and their effectiveness
- Generate weekly/monthly reports on agent usage patterns

## Success Metrics
- Complete visibility into agent selection patterns
- Identification of underutilized agents for potential optimization
- Data-driven insights for improving agent coordination
- Baseline metrics for measuring improvements from audit changes

## Notes
This task supports the broader agent audit implementation by providing quantitative data on how the agent selection improvements are performing in practice. The monitoring should be lightweight and not impact system performance.
