# Getting Started with Claude Code Template

## What This Does

Transform your Claude Code experience with:
- ‚úÖ **20+ AI agents** for different coding tasks (debugging, reviews, architecture)
- ‚úÖ **Custom slash commands** like `/review`, `/test`, `/refactor` for instant help
- ‚úÖ **Technology-specific guidance** - Python, Rust, Java, JavaScript, and more
- ‚úÖ **Persistent memory** - Claude remembers your project decisions across sessions
- ‚úÖ **Automatic setup** - One-time install, works in every project

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

**Recommended**: Use as GitHub Dotfiles
1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/your-username/claude-code-template/fork) and rename it to `dotfiles`
2. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Codespaces ‚Üí Dotfiles ‚Üí Enable
3. Open any project in Claude Code - you now have superpowers! ‚ú®

**Try immediately:**
```
/review          # Get comprehensive code feedback
/agent-guide     # Explore your AI helpers  
/discuss         # Challenge your architectural ideas
```

## Documentation Guides

| Guide | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **[Features](features.md)** | Complete overview of all capabilities |
| **[TODO System](todo-system.md)** | Task management and progress tracking |
| **[Memory System](memory-system.md)** | How persistent memory works |
| **[Customization](customization.md)** | Adapt the template for your project |

## Real-World Examples

### Debugging a Complex Bug
```
1. /discuss "Should I rewrite this authentication module?"
2. Use `hypothesis` agent to form theories about the root cause
3. /test to generate test cases that isolate the problem
```

### Architecture Review
```
1. /review to get comprehensive feedback on your code
2. Use `patterns` agent to identify improvements
3. Use `principles` agent to ensure SOLID compliance
```

### New Feature Planning
```
1. Use `explorer` agent to generate multiple approaches
2. Use `constraints` agent to handle competing requirements  
3. /discuss the trade-offs before implementing
```

## Troubleshooting

**Commands not working?**
- Make sure you're in a Claude Code session
- Check that the template was installed correctly with `ls .claude/`

**Agents not responding as expected?**
- Try being more specific about what you want
- Use `/agent-guide` to see what each agent does best

**Memory not persisting?**
- Memory is handled by Claude Code's built-in MCP memory server
- No additional setup required for basic memory functionality
