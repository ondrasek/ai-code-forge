# Features Guide

Complete overview of what this Claude Code template provides.

## ü§ñ AI Agents (20+)

Your personal team of AI specialists with **mandatory coordination** for all non-trivial requests.

### Mandatory Protocol
- **Minimum 3+ agents** automatically used for complex tasks
- **Baseline combination**: researcher + patterns + critic
- **Memory-first research**: System checks MCP memory before web searches
- **Parallel clusters**: Multiple agents work simultaneously when possible

### Essential Agents (Start Here)
| Agent | What It Does | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **`researcher`** | Finds current best practices and documentation | "What's the latest way to do X?" |
| **`patterns`** | Identifies code patterns and refactoring opportunities | Code reviews, architecture cleanup |
| **`critic`** | Provides honest feedback and challenges assumptions | Before big decisions, design reviews |

### Problem-Solving Agents
| Agent | What It Does | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **`hypothesis`** | Forms theories and tests them scientifically | Debugging complex issues |
| **`constraints`** | Handles competing requirements and trade-offs | "I need X but also Y, and they conflict" |
| **`resolver`** | Mediates when different approaches conflict | When agents give conflicting advice |

### Code Quality Agents
| Agent | What It Does | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **`completer`** | Finds missing functionality and TODOs | "What am I missing?" reviews |
| **`whisper`** | Suggests micro-improvements and polish | Final code cleanup |
| **`invariants`** | Ensures type safety and prevents invalid states | Designing robust data structures |

### Architecture Agents
| Agent | What It Does | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **`explorer`** | Generates multiple solution approaches | "What are my options?" questions |
| **`axioms`** | Builds solutions from first principles | "Why does this work?" deep understanding |
| **`context`** | Explains how systems work and interact | Understanding complex codebases |
| **`principles`** | Applies SOLID, DRY, KISS design principles | Architecture reviews, refactoring |

### Workflow Agents
| Agent | What It Does | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **`generator`** | Creates code templates and boilerplate | Repetitive code generation |
| **`prompter`** | Helps build AI agents and prompts | Creating custom Claude Code agents |
| **`time`** | Analyzes code history and evolution | Understanding how code evolved |
| **`connector`** | Finds creative cross-domain solutions | "How do other fields solve this?" |
| **`tagger`** | Automatically manages releases and versions | Automated release workflows |

## üìã Custom Commands

Ready-to-use slash commands for common tasks.

| Command | Purpose | Example Usage |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **`/review`** | Comprehensive code review | `/review` on any file or selection |
| **`/test`** | Generate tests and testing guidance | `/test` for the current function |
| **`/refactor`** | Code improvement suggestions | `/refactor` messy code sections |
| **`/security`** | Security audit and recommendations | `/security` on authentication code |

## üß† Memory System

Claude Code remembers your project across sessions.

### What Gets Remembered
- **Architectural decisions** and their reasoning
- **Code patterns** you've established
- **Design principles** your team follows
- **Debugging insights** and solutions
- **Refactoring outcomes** and lessons learned

### How It Works
1. **Automatic capture** - Insights stored as you work
2. **Cross-session persistence** - Knowledge survives restarts
3. **Team collaboration** - Shared memory via git
4. **Export/import** - Backup and restore insights

### Memory Types
- **`research_topic`** - Investigation findings
- **`architectural_decision`** - Design choices and trade-offs
- **`design_pattern`** - Code patterns and their usage
- **`principle_violation`** - Issues found and fixes applied
- **`tagging_decision`** - Release management decisions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Integration

Automatic best practices for your tech stack.

### Supported Technologies
| Technology | Features |
|------------|----------|
| **Python** | uv workflows, testing with pytest, modern Python patterns |
| **Rust** | Cargo workflows, error handling, async patterns |
| **JavaScript/TypeScript** | npm/yarn workflows, testing, modern JS patterns |
| **Java** | Maven/Gradle, Spring Boot, testing patterns |
| **Kotlin** | Backend development, coroutines, Spring integration |
| **Ruby** | Bundler workflows, Rails patterns, testing |
| **C#/.NET** | dotnet CLI, ASP.NET Core, testing patterns |
| **C++** | Modern C++20 features, CMake, testing |
| **Docker** | Container best practices, security, optimization |

### How It Works
- **Automatic detection** - Scans your project for technology indicators
- **Best practices** - Loads appropriate guidelines and patterns  
- **Tool integration** - Works with your existing toolchain
- **Agent specialization** - Agents understand your tech stack

## üéØ Context-Clean Task Management

Intelligent task coordination through specialized agents that keep your main context clean and focused.

### Agent-Based Task Orchestration
- **Delegated task management** - Agents handle complex multi-step workflows independently
- **Clean main context** - No polluting TODO lists in your primary workspace
- **Intelligent coordination** - Agents automatically break down complex requests
- **Context preservation** - Task progress stored in persistent memory

### How It Works
- **Automatic detection** - System recognizes when tasks need structured coordination
- **Agent delegation** - Complex workflows handed off to specialized task agents
- **Memory integration** - Progress and context preserved across sessions
- **Clean handoffs** - Agents return concise results without cluttering main context

### Benefits
- **Focused conversations** - Main context stays clean and on-topic
- **Comprehensive execution** - Nothing gets overlooked through agent coordination
- **Persistent progress** - Work continues seamlessly across sessions
- **Professional output** - Clean, organized results without intermediate noise

## üîß MCP Tool Integration
