# Agent Parallelism Alternatives

## Research Findings

### Key Insights
- Beyond BatchTool, multiple approaches exist for parallel agent execution
- Key frameworks include Google ADK, LangGraph, OpenAI SDK, CrewAI, and LangChain
- Major patterns: Fan-Out/Gather, Orchestrator-Worker, Concurrent Tool Execution
- Technical approaches range from async/await to actor model systems
- 2024 saw $12.2B funding in AI agent systems with focus on parallelism

## Context
This research was conducted to understand alternatives to BatchTool for implementing parallel agent execution in Claude Code configurations. The findings helped inform the optimization of agent coordination patterns in this template repository.

## Relevance
- Informed agent optimization strategies in `.claude/agents/` directory
- Contributed to understanding of Claude Code's native parallel capabilities
- Helped establish best practices for agent cluster coordination
- Influenced workflow template design for parallel execution
