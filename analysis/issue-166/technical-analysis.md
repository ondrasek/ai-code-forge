# Issue #166: Implement launch-codex.sh Script - Technical Analysis

## SITUATIONAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS

### SITUATION UNDERSTANDING:
The request is for implementing a launch-codex.sh script as part of the AI Code Forge project. Based on the analysis of the existing codebase, this appears to be creating a launcher script following the established patterns for AI development tools integration.

### RELEVANT CODEBASE CONTEXT:

#### Key Components:
- **Primary Launcher**: `/scripts/launch-claude.sh` - Comprehensive 900-line Claude Code wrapper
- **Worktree Integration**: `/scripts/worktree/worktree-launch.sh` - Specialized launcher for worktree environments
- **Worktree Management**: `/scripts/worktree/worktree.sh` - Unified interface for worktree operations
- **Project Configuration**: `/.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code configuration with default model and permissions

#### Related Patterns:
- Robust launcher scripts with comprehensive error handling and security features
- Session-based logging with timestamped directories
- Environment detection and configuration management
- Multi-agent integration for log analysis and troubleshooting

#### Dependencies:
- Existing worktree infrastructure for git branch management
- Claude Code integration patterns and MCP server support
- Environment variable loading and .env file security patterns
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring systems

#### Constraints:
- Must follow MANDATORY operational rules from CLAUDE.md
- File structure conventions: scripts must go in `/scripts/` directory
- Security patterns: input validation, permission handling, secure environment loading
- Integration requirements: must work with existing worktree and launch-claude patterns

### HISTORICAL CONTEXT:

#### Past Decisions:
- **launch-claude.sh Architecture**: Comprehensive wrapper with default logging enabled, sonnet model, master prompt loading
- **Worktree Integration**: Git worktree-based development workflow with specialized tools
- **Security-First Design**: Environment variable masking, file permission validation, command injection prevention
- **Session Management**: Timestamped logging directories with organized log separation

#### Evolution:
- Progression from simple launcher to comprehensive development environment wrapper
- Integration of multiple AI development tools (Claude Code, MCP servers)
- Security hardening with input validation and permission management
- Logging and analysis capabilities with multi-agent troubleshooting

#### Lessons Learned:
- Comprehensive error handling prevents common deployment issues
- Security validation essential for environment variable handling
- Session-based logging enables powerful analysis and troubleshooting
- Modular script design allows for specialized launchers while maintaining consistency

#### Success Patterns:
- Auto-detection of container environments (devcontainer, codespace)
- Unified command-line interface with consistent option handling
- Fallback mechanisms for missing dependencies
- Integration with existing project infrastructure

### SITUATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

#### Suggested Approach:
Based on the existing launch-claude.sh architecture and patterns:

1. **Follow Established Architecture**:
   - Create `/scripts/launch-codex.sh` following the comprehensive launcher pattern
   - Implement similar security, logging, and environment detection features
   - Provide unified CLI interface consistent with existing scripts

2. **OpenAI Codex Integration**:
   - Wrapper around OpenAI Codex CLI (assumed to be `codex` command)
   - Default configurations optimized for code generation tasks
   - Integration with existing .env file loading for API key management

3. **Security Implementation**:
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Secure environment variable handling with masking
   - Permission detection and handling for container environments

4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Session-based logging following established patterns
   - Debug and verbose modes for troubleshooting
   - Integration with log analysis agents

#### Key Considerations:
- **API Compatibility**: OpenAI Codex API may have different requirements than Anthropic Claude
- **Authentication**: Different API key patterns and authentication methods
- **Model Selection**: Codex-specific models vs Claude models
- **Output Formatting**: Different output patterns may require different log parsing
- **Rate Limiting**: OpenAI API rate limits may require different handling

#### Implementation Notes:
- **Base Template**: Use launch-claude.sh as architectural template
- **Integration Points**: Integrate with existing worktree infrastructure
- **Environment Support**: Support same environments (devcontainer, codespace, local)
- **Documentation**: Follow established documentation patterns

#### Testing Strategy:
- **Unit Testing**: Individual function validation
- **Integration Testing**: Compatibility with worktree scripts
- **Environment Testing**: Validation across different deployment environments
- **Security Testing**: Input validation and environment variable handling

### IMPACT ANALYSIS:

#### Affected Systems:
- **Scripts Infrastructure**: Addition to existing launcher script ecosystem
- **Worktree Integration**: Potential integration with worktree-deliver.sh patterns
- **Documentation**: Updates to usage guides and examples
- **Testing Infrastructure**: New test cases for Codex integration

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Low Risk**: Following established patterns reduces implementation risk
- **API Dependencies**: Dependency on OpenAI Codex service availability
- **Authentication Management**: Secure handling of OpenAI API keys
- **Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility with existing workflow patterns

#### Documentation Needs:
- **Usage Documentation**: Similar to launch-claude-usage.md
- **Integration Guide**: How launch-codex.sh fits with existing tools
- **Security Guide**: API key management and security considerations
- **Examples**: Common usage patterns and workflows

#### Migration Requirements:
- **No Breaking Changes**: Addition to existing infrastructure
- **Optional Integration**: Should not affect existing workflows
- **Gradual Adoption**: Can be adopted incrementally alongside existing tools
