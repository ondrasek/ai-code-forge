- `codex "prompt"` - Initial prompt in interactive mode  
- `codex exec "task"` - Non-interactive automation mode

**Key Flags and Options:**
```bash
-h, --help                                    # Show usage and exit
-m, --model <model>                          # Model selection (default: codex-mini-latest)
-i, --image <path>                           # Include image files as input
-v, --view <rollout>                         # Inspect previously saved rollout
-q, --quiet                                  # Non-interactive mode, structured output
-a, --approval-mode <mode>                   # Override approval policy
--auto-edit                                  # Auto-approve file edits
--full-auto                                  # Auto-approve all operations
--no-project-doc                             # Skip repository codex.md inclusion
--project-doc <file>                         # Include additional context file
--full-stdout                                # Don't truncate command outputs
--dangerously-auto-approve-everything        # Skip all confirmations (unsafe)
--provider <provider>                        # Switch model providers
--profile <profile>                          # Use predefined configuration profile
```

**Approval Modes:**
- **suggest**: Suggest changes but require approval
- **auto-edit**: Auto-approve file edits, prompt for commands
- **full-auto**: Auto-approve everything in sandbox mode

## 3. Authentication and Requirements

**Primary Authentication (Recommended):**
- Method: "Sign in with ChatGPT"
- Requirements: ChatGPT Plus, Pro, or Team account
- Benefits: Access to latest models including GPT-5 at no extra cost
- Credits: Plus users get $5, Pro users get $50 in API credits
- Eligibility: Subscription >7 days old with payment method set

**Secondary Authentication:**
- Method: OpenAI API Key
- Setup: `export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OAI_KEY>"`
- Usage: Pay-as-you-go API consumption
- Session-scoped: Environment variable per terminal session

**Subscription Benefits:**
- Plus/Pro/Team users: No extra cost for latest models
- Promotional credits expire after 30 days
- Business users: Data not used for model training by default

## 4. Environment Detection and Permissions

**Version Control Detection:**
- Automatically detects if directory is version-controlled
- Warns before entering Auto Edit or Full Auto in non-VCS directories
- Recommends appropriate autonomy levels based on VCS status

**Repository Permissions:**
- GitHub integration allows selective repository access
- User can choose all repositories or specific repositories
- Enhanced security for sensitive private repositories

**Environment Configuration:**
- Each task runs in ephemeral container with environment settings
- Internet access during setup for dependency installation
- Configurable network access control during agent execution
- Workspace admin controls container network permissions

**Sandbox Security:**
- Default sandbox prevents file access outside workspace
- Network access restrictions configurable
- Strong guardrails for model-generated commands
- User approval required for potentially dangerous operations

## 5. Configuration File Formats

**Main Configuration File:**
Location: `~/.codex/config.toml`

```toml
# Model and provider settings
[profiles.o3]
model_provider = "azure"
model = "o3"

[profiles.mistral]
model_provider = "ollama" 
model = "mistral"

# MCP Server Integration
[mcp_servers.server-name]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "mcp-server"]
env = { "API_KEY" = "value" }
```

**Alternative JSON Configuration:**
Location: `~/.codex/config.json`
- Adjustable settings for usage preferences
- Profile definitions for different configurations
- Model provider and authentication settings

**Instructions Customization:**
Location: `~/.codex/instructions.md`
- Custom system prompt modifications
- Tailored AI assistant behavior

**Agent Instructions:**
Location: `AGENTS.md` files (project and global)
- Project-specific guidance and instructions
- Hierarchical merging from global to local
- Top-down instruction precedence

## 6. Logging and Debugging Capabilities

**Rust-Based Logging System:**
- Uses standard Rust logging patterns with `RUST_LOG` environment variable
- Supports module-level log filtering and configuration
- Integration with `env_logger` crate patterns

**RUST_LOG Configuration Examples:**
```bash
# Set different log levels for different modules
RUST_LOG="warn,codex::core=info,codex::sandbox=debug" codex

# Enable all debug logging
RUST_LOG="debug" codex

# Targeted debugging for specific components
RUST_LOG="codex::auth=debug,codex::api=info" codex
```

**Quiet Mode Debugging:**
- `--quiet` flag enables non-interactive mode
- JSON-formatted output for structured logging
- Request/response logging for API interactions
- Ideal for integration debugging and automation

**Citation and Tracing:**
- Verifiable evidence of actions through citations
- Terminal logs and test outputs for traceability
- Step-by-step action documentation
- Clear communication of uncertainties and failures

**Debug Output Features:**
- Color-coded severity badges
- Inline ASCII/Unicode metric graphs
- Structured incident detail presentations
- Rich terminal visualizations for complex data

## 7. Integration Patterns

**Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Functionality:**
- Standardized protocol for third-party integrations
- Secure connection to external services and tools
- Extensible plugin system with custom command handlers

**Real-World Integration Example - Datadog:**
```toml
[mcp_servers.datadog]
command = "datadog-mcp-server"
args = ["--api-key", "${DD_API_KEY}"]
env = { "DD_SITE" = "datadoghq.com" }
```

**Integration Capabilities:**
- Retrieve application logs via natural language queries
- Fetch metrics and APM traces for services
- Update active incidents programmatically
- Check monitor statuses and alerting state
- Generate targeted code fixes based on observability data

**Third-Party Provider Support:**
- Azure OpenAI integration
- Ollama for local models
- Custom model provider configurations
- API key and authentication management per provider

**Plugin Architecture:**
- Extensible plugin system for custom functionality
- Third-party extensions with custom command handlers
- Native binary distribution for simplified deployment
- Rust tooling integration (Cargo, rustfmt, clippy)

## 8. Security Considerations

**Data Privacy and Locality:**
- Source code never leaves local environment unless explicitly shared
- All file operations happen locally on user machine
- Only prompts, high-level context, and diff summaries sent to API
- Business users' data not used for model training (configurable)

**Sandbox Security Model:**
- Built-in sandbox with strong guardrails
- Default restrictions prevent destructive tool calls
- Memory safety guarantees from Rust architecture
- Efficient execution without garbage collector overhead

**Authentication Security:**
- OAuth2 flow with ChatGPT for secure authentication
- Local credential storage with refresh token management
- API organization selection and management
- Automatic API key generation and configuration

**Permission Controls:**
- Granular repository access control
- Workspace-level permission management
- Network access controls per container
- User approval gates for sensitive operations

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Version control integration for change tracking
- Rollback capabilities through VCS integration
- User confirmation prompts for dangerous operations
- Sandbox isolation for command execution
