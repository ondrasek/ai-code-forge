# CLI Tool Requirements Analysis

## Cross-Domain Solution Inspiration

### From Package Management Systems (apt, npm, cargo)
**Similar Problem**: Dependency installation, version management, conflict resolution
**Adaptation for Claude Code**:
- **Lock Files**: Create .claude/forge.lock to track exact versions installed
- **Dependency Resolution**: Handle conflicts between user customizations and updates
- **Cache Management**: Local cache for GitHub releases to enable offline operations
- **Integrity Verification**: Checksums for downloaded templates

### From Database Migration Systems (Alembic, Flyway)
**Similar Problem**: Schema evolution, rollback capabilities, state consistency
**Adaptation for Claude Code**:
- **Migration Scripts**: Version-aware upgrade scripts for configuration changes
- **State Tracking**: .claude/version_history.json to track configuration evolution
- **Rollback Capability**: Point-in-time recovery for any previous configuration
- **Validation Hooks**: Pre/post migration checks for configuration integrity

### From Backup Systems (Time Machine, rsync)
**Similar Problem**: Incremental backups, space efficiency, restoration
**Adaptation for Claude Code**:
- **Incremental Backups**: Only store changed files in subsequent backups
- **Compression**: Zip backups to save space while maintaining quick access
- **Metadata Tracking**: Rich metadata for each backup (reason, changes, validation status)
- **Quick Preview**: Allow users to see what changed without full restoration

### From Container Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
**Similar Problem**: Configuration management, health checks, rollback on failure
**Adaptation for Claude Code**:
- **Health Checks**: Validate Claude Code functionality after configuration changes  
- **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing deployments with automatic rollback
- **Configuration Templating**: Environment-specific configuration generation
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent configuration operations from consuming excessive resources

## Missing Requirements Identified

### Configuration Validation
- **Schema Validation**: JSON/YAML schema for agent definitions and commands
- **Semantic Validation**: Ensure agent descriptions match their functionality
- **Dependency Validation**: Verify MCP servers are accessible and functional
- **Performance Validation**: Check configuration doesn't severely impact Claude Code startup

### User Experience Gaps  
- **Interactive Setup Wizard**: Guide first-time users through optimal configuration
- **Configuration Diff Viewer**: Show exactly what changes between versions
- **Template Customization**: Allow users to create and share their own templates
- **Usage Analytics**: Track which features are used to guide development

### Integration Requirements
- **IDE Integration**: Provide Claude Code configuration sync for popular IDEs
- **CI/CD Hooks**: Enable automated configuration validation in pipelines
- **Team Synchronization**: Shared configuration for development teams
- **Environment Profiles**: Different configurations for dev/staging/prod

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Configuration Drift Detection**: Alert when manual changes deviate from managed state
- **Performance Impact Monitoring**: Track Claude Code performance after configuration changes
- **Usage Metrics**: Understanding which agents/commands are most valuable
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized error reporting for configuration issues

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

### Network-Related Edge Cases
- **Partial Download Failures**: Resume interrupted GitHub release downloads
- **API Rate Limiting**: Intelligent backoff and cache utilization
- **Proxy/Firewall Issues**: Detection and guidance for network restrictions
- **DNS Resolution Problems**: Fallback mechanisms for GitHub connectivity

### File System Edge Cases
- **Disk Space Exhaustion**: Check available space before operations
- **Permission Changes**: Handle permission changes mid-operation
- **Concurrent Access**: Prevent multiple tool instances from conflicting
- **Symbolic Link Handling**: Proper handling of symlinked directories

### Git Repository Edge Cases
- **Dirty Working Directory**: Guidance for users with uncommitted changes
- **Detached HEAD State**: Handle repositories not on a branch
- **Submodule Conflicts**: Interaction with git submodules
- **Large File Handling**: Performance with repositories containing large files

### Configuration Edge Cases
- **Partial Configurations**: Handle repositories with only .claude or only .support
- **Custom Modifications**: Preserve user customizations during upgrades
- **Conflicting Agents**: Handle duplicate agent names or conflicting functionality
- **Broken Configurations**: Recovery from corrupted or invalid configurations

## Security Threat Model

### Attack Vectors
- **Malicious Templates**: Validation required for downloaded GitHub releases
- **Path Traversal**: Prevent access outside allowed directories
- **Command Injection**: Sanitize all user inputs and file paths
- **Privilege Escalation**: Ensure tool runs with minimal required permissions

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate all paths, URLs, and user inputs
- **Sandboxing**: Restrict file system access to designated directories
- **Signature Verification**: Verify authenticity of downloaded templates
- **Audit Logging**: Log all configuration changes for security monitoring

### Compliance Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure no sensitive data is included in backups/logs
- **Access Control**: Respect existing file permissions and ownership
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive configuration data in backups
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable backup retention and cleanup

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability Requirements
- **Large Repository Support**: Handle repositories with thousands of files
- **Memory Efficiency**: Process large configurations without excessive memory usage
- **Concurrent Operations**: Support multiple repositories simultaneously
- **Cache Optimization**: Intelligent caching to minimize network requests

### Performance Metrics
- **Operation Speed**: <30s for init, <10s for status checks, <60s for upgrades
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB peak memory usage for typical operations
- **Network Efficiency**: Minimal redundant downloads, effective caching
- **Startup Time**: <2s for CLI startup and help display

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function and class testing with mocks
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end command testing with real file systems
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing with large repositories and configurations
- **Security Tests**: Input validation, path traversal, injection prevention

### Test Data Strategy
- **Synthetic Repositories**: Generated test repositories with various configurations
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Test against actual Claude Code repository configurations
- **Edge Case Generation**: Automated generation of edge case test scenarios
- **Regression Testing**: Automated testing of all previous bug fixes

### Continuous Testing
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run fast tests before code commits
- **CI Pipeline**: Comprehensive test suite on multiple Python versions and platforms
- **Nightly Testing**: Extended test suites including performance and security tests
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Beta testing with real users before releases
