# Issue 177: Technical Analysis - Worktree Launch "main" Branch Support

## Problem Analysis

The `worktree-launch.sh` script currently fails when users specify "main" as a branch argument. The issue occurs in the `find_worktree_dir()` function which only searches worktree directories by name, not by the actual git branch checked out in each worktree.

### Current Implementation Issues

1. **Directory Name Search Only**: The script searches for directories named "main" rather than worktrees containing the main branch
2. **No Git Branch Resolution**: Missing `git worktree list --porcelain` integration to find which worktree has "main" checked out
3. **Inconsistent with Other Scripts**: `worktree-list.sh` already has branch resolution logic that should be reused

### Root Cause

The `find_worktree_dir()` function in `worktree-launch.sh` (lines 86-137) only performs directory name matching:

```bash
# Current problematic logic:
local target_dir="$base_dir/$clean_id"
if [[ -d "$target_dir" ]]; then
    echo "$target_dir"
    return 0
fi
```

It lacks the git worktree branch resolution that exists in `worktree-list.sh`.

## Technical Architecture Analysis

### Current Worktree Scripts Structure

1. **`worktree.sh`**: Main dispatcher that routes commands to specific scripts
2. **`worktree-launch.sh`**: Launches Claude Code in specified worktree (THE PROBLEM SCRIPT)
3. **`worktree-create.sh`**: Creates new worktrees with comprehensive validation
4. **`worktree-list.sh`**: Lists worktrees with branch resolution (HAS SOLUTION PATTERN)
5. **`worktree-path.sh`**: Outputs worktree paths (SECURITY-FOCUSED, LIMITED TO ISSUE NUMBERS)

### Git Worktree Integration Patterns

From `worktree-list.sh`, the proven pattern for branch resolution:

```bash
# Working pattern from worktree-list.sh lines 59-70:
worktree_path=$(git worktree list --porcelain | awk -v branch="$branch_name" '
    /^worktree / { path = substr($0, 10) }
    /^branch refs\/heads\// && substr($0, 19) == branch { print path; exit }
')
```

### Current Git Worktree State

From `git worktree list --porcelain`:
```
worktree /workspace/ai-code-forge
HEAD 83736745449deae4457aa0ab33cdbf01eb8d285d
branch refs/heads/main

worktree /workspace/worktrees/ai-code-forge/issue-172
HEAD de2325a2eba410fda067366594ef0c7a77c3b204
branch refs/heads/issue-172-fix-researcher-agent

worktree /workspace/worktrees/ai-code-forge/issue-173
HEAD 1c11bdfd4564a07283b6b202d217048a114a5c0c
branch refs/heads/issue-173-feat-implement-terminal

worktree /workspace/worktrees/ai-code-forge/issue-177
HEAD 83736745449deae4457aa0ab33cdbf01eb8d285d
branch refs/heads/issue-177-fix-worktree-launch
```

**Key Finding**: The main branch is checked out at `/workspace/ai-code-forge` (the primary repo), not in `/workspace/worktrees/ai-code-forge/main`.

## Security Analysis

### Current Security Measures
- Input sanitization in `validate_branch_name()` 
- Path traversal prevention
- Symlink validation with `validate_no_symlinks()`
- Canonical path validation

### Security Considerations for Branch Resolution
- **Input Validation**: Must validate branch names before git operations
- **Path Security**: Resolved paths must stay within security boundaries
- **Command Injection**: Git commands must use proper argument arrays
- **Race Conditions**: Branch resolution should be atomic

## Implementation Strategy

### Approach 1: Extend Current Architecture (RECOMMENDED)

**Modify `worktree-launch.sh` to add branch resolution capability:**

1. **Add Branch Detection Logic**: Distinguish between directory paths and branch names
2. **Integrate Git Worktree Resolution**: Use `git worktree list --porcelain` for branch lookups
3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Preserve existing directory path behavior
4. **Security**: Validate branch names and resolved paths

### Approach 2: Unify with worktree-path.sh

**Extend `worktree-path.sh` to support branch names, then use it from `worktree-launch.sh`:**

Pros:
- Centralized path resolution logic
- Consistent behavior across scripts

Cons:
- `worktree-path.sh` is intentionally security-restricted to issue numbers only
- Would require significant security architecture changes

## Technical Constraints

### Existing Patterns to Preserve
1. **Error Handling**: Consistent colored output and error messages
2. **Security**: All existing input validation and path security
3. **Dry Run Support**: `--dry-run` flag functionality
4. **Claude Command Detection**: Fallback to `launch-claude.sh` script

### Git Version Dependencies
- Requires Git 2.5+ for `git worktree` functionality
- `--porcelain` flag requires Git 2.7+

### Edge Cases to Handle
1. **Multiple Main Worktrees**: Main branch in multiple worktrees (should error or pick primary)
2. **Detached HEAD**: Worktrees in detached HEAD state
3. **Missing Main**: No worktree has main branch checked out
4. **Bare Repositories**: Bare worktrees without branches

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Branch Resolution (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Add `find_worktree_by_branch()` function using proven `worktree-list.sh` pattern
- Modify `find_worktree_dir()` to detect branch vs directory arguments
- Implement branch-to-path resolution with security validation

### Phase 2: Edge Case Handling (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Handle detached HEAD scenarios
- Implement multiple worktree conflict resolution
- Add comprehensive error messages

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Create test cases for branch resolution
- Update help text and examples
- Validate backward compatibility

### Phase 4: Integration (LOW PRIORITY)
- Consider unifying branch resolution across all worktree scripts
- Performance optimization for large worktree sets

## Expected Outcomes

### Success Metrics
- `./worktree-launch.sh main` successfully launches Claude in main branch worktree
- All existing functionality preserved
- Clear error messages for edge cases
- Security boundaries maintained

### Performance Impact
- Minimal: One additional `git worktree list --porcelain` call for branch arguments
- Negligible overhead for existing directory path arguments

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Backward compatibility impact (existing directory paths still work)
- Performance degradation (single git command addition)

### Medium Risk
- Security vulnerabilities from branch name injection
- Edge case handling for complex worktree configurations

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive input validation using existing patterns
- Extensive testing with various worktree configurations
- Security review of all git command executions
