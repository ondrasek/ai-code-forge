# Issue #195: Comprehensive Claude Code Logging System - Technical Analysis

## SITUATIONAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS

### SITUATION UNDERSTANDING
This analysis covers implementing a comprehensive logging system for Claude Code to enable debugging and development visibility into:
- Agent delegation and communication patterns 
- Tool invocation chains and execution flows
- Sub-agent spawning and recursion prevention
- Performance bottlenecks and execution timing
- Error propagation and failure analysis
- User interaction patterns and workflow optimization

### RELEVANT CODEBASE CONTEXT

#### Current Logging Infrastructure

**Existing MCP Server Logging**:
- **Perplexity MCP**: Full featured logging with environment controls (`PERPLEXITY_LOG_LEVEL`, `PERPLEXITY_LOG_PATH`)
- **OpenAI Structured MCP**: Comprehensive API request/response logging with privacy controls
- **Structured Format**: JSON-based request correlation, timing metrics, error tracking
- **Security Features**: Credential redaction, content privacy controls, session timestamping

**Key Patterns from MCP Logging**:
```python
# Environment-controlled logging with fail-fast validation
env_log_level = os.getenv("PERPLEXITY_LOG_LEVEL", log_level).upper()
if env_log_level == "NONE" or not env_log_level:
    logger.disabled = True
    return logger

# Repository root auto-detection for relative paths
while repo_root.parent != repo_root:
    if (repo_root / '.git').exists():
        break
    repo_root = repo_root.parent

# Session-based log directories with timestamp isolation
session_timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
log_path = f"{base_log_path.rstrip('/')}/perplexity_{session_timestamp}"

# Debug decorators for function timing and error tracking
@debug_decorator
async def api_function():
    # Function automatically logged with entry/exit, timing, errors
```

**CLI Installer Infrastructure**:
- Installation logic in `/workspace/worktrees/ai-code-forge/issue-195/cli/src/ai_code_forge/core/installer.py`
- Package data management and resource location
- Directory creation with error handling
- Development vs installed package detection

#### Agent Delegation Architecture

**Core Agent System**:
- **Foundation Agents**: `context`, `critic`, `patterns`, `principles`, `researcher`, `conflicts`
- **Specialist Agents**: `git-workflow`, `github-issues-workflow`, `github-pr-workflow`, `stack-advisor`, etc.
- **Command Layer**: `.claude/commands/` with YAML frontmatter for metadata
- **Task Tool Delegation**: Commands use `Task(agent-name)` for delegation

**Agent Communication Patterns**:
```yaml
# Command structure pattern
---
description: Command description
argument-hint: Usage hint  
allowed-tools: Task, Bash, Read, etc.
---

# Command delegates to agents via Task tool
Use Task tool to delegate to github-issues-workflow agent:
- Analyze $ARGUMENTS and create GitHub issue
- Apply binary confidence system for priority
- Return issue URL and assessment
```

**Recursion Prevention System**:
- **Terminal Agents**: All foundation and specialist agents marked as terminal nodes
- **SUB-AGENT RESTRICTION**: Prevents Task tool usage in terminal agents
- **Context Isolation**: Complex operations happen in agent context, not main thread
- **Clean Reporting**: Agents return only actionable results, not process details

**Agent Delegation Flow**:
1. **Command Layer** → Task(agent-name) → **Specialist Agent**
2. **Specialist Agent** → Direct tool usage (no further Task calls)  
3. **Agent Context** → Clean results back to main context
4. **Main Context** → User interaction and confirmation

#### Tool Invocation Mechanisms

**Primary Tools Used by Agents**:
- **Bash**: Git operations, file system tasks, GitHub CLI (`gh`) commands
- **Read/Edit/Write**: File manipulation and code changes  
- **Grep/Glob**: Code search and analysis
- **WebSearch/WebFetch**: External research capabilities
- **Task**: Agent delegation (only from commands, not agents)

**GitHub Integration Patterns**:
```bash
# Standard GitHub CLI patterns
gh issue list --repo ondrasek/ai-code-forge --json number,title,labels
gh pr create --repo ondrasek/ai-code-forge --title "Title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Structured PR description
EOF
)"
gh label list --repo ondrasek/ai-code-forge --json name,color,description
```

**Git Workflow Integration**:
- **Mandatory Rule**: `Task(git-workflow)` after EVERY change
- **Intelligent Staging**: File analysis, security validation, issue detection
- **Error Recovery**: Systematic diagnostics and fallback procedures
- **Branch Management**: Simplified approach working on current branch

#### Execution Context Patterns

**Interactive vs Non-Interactive Execution**:
- **MCP Servers**: No console handlers (STDIO used for protocol)
- **CLI Tool**: Click-based interface with progress indicators
- **Agent Contexts**: Isolated execution environments
- **Error Handling**: Context-aware error propagation and recovery

**Session Management**:
- **Timestamp-based Sessions**: Each execution gets unique session directory
- **Repository Root Detection**: Automatic path resolution for relative configurations
- **Permission Validation**: Fail-fast directory creation and write testing
- **Resource Cleanup**: Temporary file management and cleanup procedures

### IDENTIFIED LOGGING INSERTION POINTS

#### 1. Command Execution Layer
**Location**: `.claude/commands/*` processing
**Log Events**:
- Command invocation with arguments and user context
- Parameter validation and processing
- Tool authorization and availability checks  
- Command completion status and timing

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# Command wrapper logging
def log_command_execution(command_name: str, arguments: str, user_context: dict):
    logger = get_command_logger()
    execution_id = f"cmd_{int(time.time() * 1000)}_{id(arguments) % 10000}"
    
    logger.info(f"COMMAND_START: {json.dumps({
        'execution_id': execution_id,
        'command': command_name,
        'arguments': arguments,
        'user_context': user_context,
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
    })}")
    
    return execution_id
```

#### 2. Task Tool Delegation Points
**Location**: Task tool invocations throughout command system
**Log Events**:
- Agent delegation requests with target agent and context
- Agent spawn success/failure and timing
- Context transfer between main thread and agent
- Agent response processing and integration

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# Task tool wrapper
def log_task_delegation(agent_name: str, task_context: dict, parent_context: str):
    logger = get_delegation_logger()
    delegation_id = f"task_{int(time.time() * 1000)}_{id(task_context) % 10000}"
    
    logger.info(f"TASK_DELEGATE: {json.dumps({
        'delegation_id': delegation_id,
        'parent_context': parent_context,
        'target_agent': agent_name,
        'task_context': sanitize_context(task_context),
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
    })}")
    
    return delegation_id
```

#### 3. Agent Internal Operations
**Location**: Within specialist and foundation agents
**Log Events**:
- Agent initialization and configuration loading
- Internal state transitions and decision points
- Tool invocations from within agents
- Error conditions and recovery attempts
- Agent completion and result preparation

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# Agent operation decorator
@log_agent_operation
def agent_internal_function(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # Automatic logging of agent operations
    # Function entry/exit, timing, error handling
    pass
```

#### 4. Tool Invocation Chain Tracking
**Location**: All tool invocations (Bash, Read, Edit, etc.)
**Log Events**:
- Tool invocation with sanitized parameters
- Tool execution timing and resource usage
- Tool success/failure status with error details
- Output size and processing time
- Cross-tool dependency chains

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# Tool execution wrapper
def log_tool_execution(tool_name: str, parameters: dict, context: str):
    logger = get_tool_logger()
    tool_execution_id = f"tool_{int(time.time() * 1000)}_{id(parameters) % 10000}"
    
    # Sanitize parameters for logging
    safe_params = sanitize_tool_parameters(tool_name, parameters)
    
    logger.debug(f"TOOL_EXECUTE: {json.dumps({
        'execution_id': tool_execution_id,
        'tool_name': tool_name,
        'parameters': safe_params,
        'context': context,
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
    })}")
    
    return tool_execution_id
```

#### 5. Error Propagation and Recovery
**Location**: Error handling throughout the system
**Log Events**:
- Error occurrence with full context and stack traces
- Error recovery attempts and success/failure
- User intervention points and outcomes
- System state during error conditions

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# Error tracking with context preservation
def log_error_with_context(error: Exception, context: dict, recovery_attempted: bool = False):
    logger = get_error_logger()
    error_id = f"err_{int(time.time() * 1000)}_{id(error) % 10000}"
    
    logger.error(f"ERROR_OCCURRED: {json.dumps({
        'error_id': error_id,
        'error_type': type(error).__name__,
        'error_message': str(error),
        'context': sanitize_error_context(context),
        'recovery_attempted': recovery_attempted,
        'stack_trace': traceback.format_exc(),
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
    })}")
```

### TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS AND LIMITATIONS

#### Architecture Limitations

**Agent Context Isolation**:
- Agents operate in isolated contexts with no shared state

### CONCLUSION

Implementing comprehensive logging for Claude Code presents significant technical and architectural challenges but offers substantial value for development, debugging, and system optimization. The existing MCP server logging infrastructure provides a strong foundation that can be extended and adapted for Claude Code's specific needs.

The key to successful implementation is careful attention to performance impact, security and privacy considerations, and integration with existing agent and command architecture. A phased approach allows for gradual implementation with validation at each stage.

The logging system should be designed as an optional development and debugging aid rather than a required component, with clear configuration options and minimal impact on normal operations when disabled or set to minimal logging levels.
