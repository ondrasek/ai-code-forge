# Issue #195: Specific Use Case Analysis and Refined Implementation

## USER-DEFINED SCENARIOS ANALYSIS

Based on the specific scenarios outlined, this analysis refines the logging implementation to focus on **development and optimization insights** rather than general debugging:

### üéØ Core Use Cases

#### 1. MCP Server Usage Analysis Across Sub-Agents
**Objective**: Track how sub-agents interact with MCP servers
**Questions to Answer**:
- Which MCP servers does each sub-agent utilize?
- How frequently are specific MCP tools invoked?
- What are the request/response patterns?
- Are there MCP server bottlenecks or failures?
- How do different sub-agents use the same MCP tools differently?

#### 2. Tool Usage Pattern Analysis  
**Objective**: Understand tool utilization patterns across sub-agents
**Questions to Answer**:
- Which tools (Read/Write/Bash/etc.) are most frequently used by each sub-agent?
- What are the parameter patterns for tool invocations?
- How do tool usage patterns correlate with task success/failure?
- Are there tool performance bottlenecks?
- Which sub-agents have the most diverse tool usage?

#### 3. Prompt Engineering Impact Evaluation
**Objective**: Measure how prompt variations affect MCP/tool usage
**Questions to Answer**:
- How do different prompt styles affect tool selection?
- Do certain prompt patterns lead to more efficient MCP usage?
- What is the relationship between prompt complexity and tool diversity?
- How do prompt engineering changes impact sub-agent delegation patterns?

#### 4. Sub-Agent Definition Effectiveness Analysis
**Objective**: Evaluate sub-agent usage patterns and optimization opportunities
**Questions to Answer**:
- Which sub-agents are most/least frequently delegated to?
- What are the delegation success rates for each sub-agent?
- How do sub-agent definition changes affect usage patterns?
- Are there underutilized or overutilized sub-agents?
- What are the common delegation failure modes?

## REFINED IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### üìä Analytics Dashboard Requirements

#### 1. MCP Server Analytics
- **Usage heatmap**: Which sub-agents use which MCP servers most frequently
- **Performance metrics**: Response times, error rates, retry patterns
- **Efficiency analysis**: Successful vs failed MCP operations per sub-agent
- **Correlation analysis**: MCP usage patterns vs task success rates

#### 2. Tool Usage Analytics  
- **Tool frequency matrix**: Sub-agent √ó Tool usage patterns
- **Parameter pattern analysis**: Common parameter combinations and success rates
- **Performance profiling**: Tool execution times and bottlenecks
- **Tool chain analysis**: Sequences of tool usage within sub-agents

#### 3. Prompt Engineering Impact Dashboard
- **Prompt style effectiveness**: How different prompt patterns affect delegation and tool usage
- **Complexity vs efficiency**: Relationship between prompt complexity and execution efficiency
- **Agent selection accuracy**: How well prompts lead to appropriate sub-agent selection
- **Tool selection optimization**: How prompts influence tool usage patterns

#### 4. Sub-Agent Effectiveness Dashboard
- **Delegation frequency**: Usage statistics for each defined sub-agent
- **Success rate analysis**: Completion rates and failure modes per sub-agent
- **Specialization metrics**: How focused vs general each sub-agent's tool usage is
- **Optimization opportunities**: Under/over-utilized sub-agents and definition improvements

### üéõÔ∏è Configuration for Analytics Focus

#### Environment Variables (Simplified for Analytics)
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
export CLAUDE_CODE_ANALYTICS_PATH=logs/claude-code-analytics
export CLAUDE_CODE_ANALYTICS_LEVEL=detailed  # minimal/standard/detailed
export CLAUDE_CODE_ANALYTICS_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```

#### Analytics Collection Modes
- **minimal**: Only delegation events and success/failure outcomes
- **standard**: Include tool and MCP usage with timing data
- **detailed**: Full parameter capture with sanitization for prompt analysis

### üîç Specific Implementation for Your Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: MCP Server Debugging Across Sub-Agents

**Enhanced MCP Logging in Sub-Agents**:
```python
class SubAgentMCPLogger:
    def log_mcp_interaction(self, agent_name, mcp_server, tool_name, params, result):
        """Log MCP interaction with sub-agent context."""
        log_entry = {
            "event_type": "mcp_interaction",
            "executing_agent": agent_name,
            "mcp_server": mcp_server,
            "tool_name": tool_name,
            "sanitized_params": self.sanitize_params(params),
            "success": result.success,
            "execution_time_ms": result.duration,
            "error_details": result.error if not result.success else None,
            "retry_attempt": result.retry_count
        }
        self.analytics_logger.info(log_entry)
```

#### Use Case 2: Tool Usage Pattern Analysis

**Tool Execution Wrapper with Agent Context**:
```python
@analytics_logger.track_tool_usage
def enhanced_tool_execution(tool_name, parameters, executing_agent):
    """Wrap tool execution with analytics tracking."""
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        result = execute_tool(tool_name, parameters)
        success = True
        error_type = None
    except Exception as e:
        result = None
        success = False
        error_type = type(e).__name__
    
    duration_ms = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
    
    analytics_logger.log_tool_usage({
        "tool_name": tool_name,
        "executing_agent": executing_agent,
        "parameters_hash": hash_parameters(parameters),
        "success": success,
        "duration_ms": duration_ms,
        "error_type": error_type
    })
    
    return result
```

#### Use Case 3: Prompt Engineering Evaluation

**Prompt Analysis and Correlation**:
```python
class PromptAnalyzer:
    def analyze_prompt_impact(self, initial_prompt, execution_trace):
        """Correlate prompt characteristics with execution patterns."""
        prompt_features = {
            "length": len(initial_prompt),
            "instruction_clarity": self.assess_clarity(initial_prompt),
            "context_richness": self.assess_context(initial_prompt),
            "agent_hints": self.extract_agent_hints(initial_prompt)
        }
        
        execution_metrics = {
            "delegations_count": len(execution_trace.delegations),
            "tools_used": execution_trace.total_tools,
            "mcp_calls": execution_trace.total_mcp_calls,
            "completion_time": execution_trace.duration,
            "success_rate": execution_trace.success_rate
        }
        
        return {
            "prompt_features": prompt_features,
            "execution_metrics": execution_metrics,
            "correlation_score": self.calculate_correlation(prompt_features, execution_metrics)
        }
```

#### Use Case 4: Sub-Agent Definition Effectiveness

**Sub-Agent Usage Analytics**:
```python
class SubAgentAnalytics:
    def track_delegation_effectiveness(self):
        """Analyze sub-agent delegation patterns and effectiveness."""
        return {
            "delegation_frequency": self.get_delegation_counts(),
            "success_rates": self.calculate_success_rates(),
            "tool_specialization": self.analyze_tool_patterns(),
            "average_execution_time": self.get_performance_metrics(),
            "user_satisfaction_proxy": self.estimate_satisfaction(),
            "optimization_suggestions": self.generate_recommendations()
        }
```
