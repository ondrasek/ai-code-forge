# Implementation Notes - Issue #213: Enhanced Issue Creation Workflow

## Implementation Strategy: Enhanced 8-Step Workflow with Extended Actor/Critic Pattern

Based on stakeholder feedback, we're implementing the full 8-step workflow that extends the proven actor/critic pattern from priority validation to comprehensive content quality validation.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Location**: `.claude/commands/issue/create.md`
- **Current Flow**: Direct github-issues-workflow agent + critic validation
- **State**: Stateless, immediate execution
- **Integration**: Uses existing BINARY CONFIDENCE SYSTEM
- **Labels**: Dynamic discovery via `gh label list`

### Existing Quality Systems
- **BINARY CONFIDENCE SYSTEM**: 6-criteria priority assessment
- **Critic Integration**: Priority validation and quality review
- **Label Discovery**: Dynamic repository label integration
- **Agent Coordination**: Terminal agent pattern prevents recursion loops

## Implemented 8-Step Workflow Architecture

### COMPLETED: Full 8-Step Enhancement
**Target**: Extended actor/critic pattern for comprehensive content quality validation

#### Implementation Details
```markdown
# File: .claude/commands/issue/create.md
## Workflow Options:
- `issue:create` (default): Enhanced 8-step workflow
- `issue:create --express`: Legacy 2-phase workflow (backwards compatible)
```

### Extended Actor/Critic Pattern Implementation

#### **Steps 1-2: Draft and Refine (Actor)**
- github-issues-workflow agent creates comprehensive initial draft
- Same agent refines content for clarity, specificity, and actionability
- Focus on completeness and developer comprehension

#### **Step 3: Content Criticism (Critic)**
- critic agent applies **Content Quality Criteria**:
  - Anti-Generic Detection (flags templated language, empty phrases)
  - Specificity Challenge (demands concrete examples, measurable outcomes)
  - Actionability Test (verifies developer can understand what to build)
  - Value Validation (confirms clear user/business value)
  - Scope Clarity (ensures implementation boundaries are defined)
  - Technical Depth (assesses sufficient technical context)

#### **Step 4: Adjustment (Actor)**
- github-issues-workflow agent addresses specific critic feedback
- Eliminates vague language and generic phrases
- Adds concrete examples and technical specifics
- Improves overall issue quality and actionability

#### **Steps 5-6: Label and Priority Assignment (Actor)**
- Dynamic label discovery via `gh label list` 
- Existing BINARY CONFIDENCE SYSTEM for priority assessment
- Maintains all existing sophisticated priority logic

#### **Steps 7-8: Label and Priority Validation (Critic)**
- critic agent validates label appropriateness and accuracy
- critic agent applies existing skeptical priority validation
- Prevents priority inflation through rigorous evidence requirements

#### **Step 9: Final Creation (Actor)**
- github-issues-workflow agent creates issue with comprehensive analysis comments
- Complete audit trail of content refinement and validation decisions

#### 1.2 Enhanced github-issues-workflow Agent
**Modifications to existing agent**:
- Add optional refinement step before final creation
- Implement confidence scoring for content quality
- Add label validation with criticism step
- Enhanced priority validation with BINARY CONFIDENCE SYSTEM

#### 1.3 State Management (Optional)
```json
// File: .acforge/workflows/issue-create-session.json (temporary)
{
  "mode": "detailed|express",
  "step": "draft|refine|label|priority|validate",
  "content": {...},
  "metadata": {...},
  "created": "2025-09-02T...",
  "ttl": "24h"
}
```

### Phase 2: Quality Enhancements (Medium Priority)
**Target**: Add sophisticated validation and quality controls

#### 2.1 Confidence Scoring System
```typescript
interface QualityScore {
  completeness: number;    // 0-100: description, acceptance criteria, etc.
  clarity: number;         // 0-100: readability, structure
  actionability: number;   // 0-100: specific, implementable
  priority_confidence: number; // 0-100: BINARY CONFIDENCE SYSTEM score
  overall: number;         // weighted average
}
```

#### 2.2 Enhanced Criticism Integration
- **Refinement Criticism**: Content quality and completeness
- **Label Criticism**: Appropriateness and accuracy validation
- **Priority Criticism**: Enhanced BINARY CONFIDENCE SYSTEM validation
- **Final Review**: Comprehensive quality check before creation

#### 2.3 Template Integration
- **GitHub Templates**: Integrate with repository issue templates
- **Dynamic Templates**: AI-suggested templates based on content analysis
- **Validation Rules**: Template compliance checking

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
**Target**: Advanced workflow management and analytics

#### 3.1 Workflow Management
- **Resume Capability**: Restart interrupted workflows
- **Draft Management**: Save, list, edit, delete draft issues
- **Cleanup Automation**: Automatic removal of expired drafts

#### 3.2 Analytics and Optimization
- **Usage Tracking**: Workflow step completion rates
- **Quality Metrics**: Issue refinement needs, priority accuracy
- **User Feedback**: Satisfaction and workflow preference tracking
