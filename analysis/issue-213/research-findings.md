## 1. MODERN GITHUB ISSUE CREATION BEST PRACTICES (2025)

### AI-Enhanced Issue Processing
- **GitHub Models Integration**: Native AI inference in GitHub Actions workflows
- **Automated Triage**: AI-powered issue quality assessment and validation
- **Copilot-Assisted Drafting**: Direct issue creation with context awareness
- **IssueOps Workflows**: Issue-driven automation for complex processes

### Essential Issue Structure Components
```yaml
Issue Quality Framework:
  title:
    pattern: "[Noun] – [Verb]" 
    example: "Login button – disable on Safari 17 beta"
  
  content_sections:
    - problem_statement: "As a [user], I [action], so I [outcome]"
    - expected_behavior: Clear, measurable outcome
    - actual_behavior: Observable deviation from expected
    - reproduction_steps: Numbered, specific steps
    - visual_evidence: Screenshots, GIFs, command output
    - acceptance_criteria: Definition of done checklist
```

### GitHub Models for Automated Validation
```yaml
# GitHub Actions AI validation pattern
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  models: read

workflow_triggers:
  - issue_opened
  - issue_edited
  
validation_criteria:
  - reproduction_steps_present
  - sufficient_context_provided
  - labels_appropriate
  - priority_assessable
```

## 2. STEP-BY-STEP ISSUE REFINEMENT METHODOLOGIES

### Multi-Phase Refinement Workflow
```
Phase 1: Draft Creation
├─ Initial problem description
├─ Context gathering
├─ Stakeholder identification
└─ Preliminary scope definition

Phase 2: Structured Review
├─ Quality validation against criteria
├─ Missing information identification
├─ Clarity and completeness check
└─ Technical feasibility assessment

Phase 3: Enhancement & Validation
├─ Add reproduction steps
├─ Include visual evidence
├─ Define acceptance criteria
└─ Set priority and confidence scores

Phase 4: Finalization
├─ Label assignment
├─ Assignee selection
├─ Milestone/project linking
└─ Issue creation with metadata
```

### Draft-Refine-Create Pattern
- **Iterative Improvement**: Multiple review cycles before creation
- **Stakeholder Validation**: Team review during refinement process
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation at each step
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain draft state between sessions

## 3. ISSUE QUALITY VALIDATION & CRITICISM FRAMEWORKS

### RICE-Based Confidence Assessment
```yaml
confidence_scoring:
  high: ">= 80%"      # Clear requirements, proven approach
  medium: "50-79%"    # Some uncertainty, needs validation
  low: "< 50%"        # High uncertainty, requires research
  
evaluation_factors:
  - requirement_clarity
  - technical_feasibility  
  - resource_availability
  - implementation_complexity
```

### Quality Validation Criteria
```yaml
completeness_check:
  required_sections: ["problem", "expected", "actual", "steps"]
  optional_sections: ["screenshots", "logs", "environment"]
  
clarity_assessment:
  - actionable_title
  - specific_problem_statement
  - measurable_outcomes
  - reproducible_steps
  
technical_validation:
  - environment_details
  - version_information
  - dependency_context
  - error_messages
```

### Automated Quality Scoring
```typescript
interface IssueQualityScore {
  completeness: 0-100;    // All required sections present
  clarity: 0-100;         // Language specificity and precision  
  actionability: 0-100;   // Can team act on this immediately
  confidence: 0-100;      // Certainty in problem/solution fit
  
  overall: number;        // Weighted composite score
  recommendation: 'approve' | 'needs_work' | 'reject';
}
```

## 4. PRIORITY ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS & CONFIDENCE-BASED ASSIGNMENT

### Modern Prioritization Frameworks (2025)

#### RICE Framework (Recommended)
```yaml
rice_scoring:
  reach: "Number of users/systems affected"
  impact: "Magnitude of effect (1-5 scale)"
  confidence: "Certainty percentage (50-100%)"
  effort: "Development time in person-weeks"
  
calculation: "(Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort"
```

#### ICE Framework (Alternative)
```yaml
ice_scoring:
  impact: "Business/user value (1-10)"
  confidence: "Implementation certainty (1-10)" 
  ease: "Development simplicity (1-10)"
  
calculation: "Impact × Confidence × Ease"
```

### Confidence-Based Assignment Logic
```typescript
interface AssignmentStrategy {
  confidence_threshold: {
    auto_assign: 85;      // High confidence, direct assignment
    team_review: 60;      // Medium confidence, team decision
    research_needed: 40;  // Low confidence, spike/research required
  };
  
  assignment_rules: {
    high_confidence: "assign_to_expert";
    medium_confidence: "assign_to_team_lead";
    low_confidence: "assign_to_research_queue";
  };
}
```

## 5. LABEL SELECTION & VALIDATION APPROACHES

### Hierarchical Label Strategy
```yaml
label_categories:
  type:
    values: ["bug", "feature", "docs", "refactor", "test", "chore"]
    required: true
    
  priority:
    values: ["critical", "high", "medium", "low"]
    auto_assign: true # Based on confidence scoring
    
  status:
    values: ["triage", "in-progress", "blocked", "ready-for-review"]
    workflow_managed: true
    
  effort:
    values: ["xs", "s", "m", "l", "xl"]  # T-shirt sizing
    confidence_dependent: true
```

### Label Validation Rules
```typescript
interface LabelValidation {
  required_labels: string[];           // Must have these
  mutually_exclusive: string[][];      // Cannot have these together  
  dependent_labels: Record<string, string[]>;  // If X then must have Y
  confidence_thresholds: Record<string, number>; // Min confidence for label
}
```

## 6. WORKFLOW INTERRUPTION & RESUME PATTERNS

### CLI Multi-Step State Management
```typescript
interface WorkflowState {
  session_id: string;
  current_step: number;
  total_steps: number;
  step_data: Record<string, any>;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
  resumable: boolean;
}
```

### Resume Patterns
```bash
# Save workflow state
acforge issue create --save-draft --id=session-123

# Resume from saved state  
acforge issue resume --id=session-123

# List resumable sessions
acforge issue list-drafts

# Clean up abandoned sessions
acforge issue cleanup-drafts --older-than=7d
```

### Error Recovery Strategies
```yaml
interruption_handling:
  save_frequency: "after_each_step"
  auto_save: true
  recovery_prompts: "resume_or_restart"
  data_validation: "on_resume"
  
timeout_management:
  session_timeout: "24_hours"
  warning_threshold: "30_minutes"
  cleanup_schedule: "daily"
```

## 7. GITHUB CLI INTEGRATION PATTERNS

### Modern CLI Workflow Commands (2025)
```bash
# GitHub CLI workflow management
gh workflow list                    # Available workflows
gh workflow run workflow-name        # Manual trigger
gh workflow enable/disable          # State management
gh run watch                        # Real-time monitoring
gh run rerun                        # Retry operations
```

### Multi-Step Operation Patterns
```typescript
interface MultiStepCLI {
  steps: Array<{
    name: string;
    command: string;
    validation: (result: any) => boolean;
    retry_on_failure: boolean;
    timeout: number;
  }>;
  
  state_persistence: {
    location: string;      // ~/.acforge/drafts/
    format: 'json' | 'yaml';
    encryption: boolean;
  };
  
  error_handling: {
    continue_on_error: boolean;
    rollback_strategy: 'none' | 'previous_step' | 'full';
    user_confirmation: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Triangular Workflow Support
- **Enhanced GitHub CLI v2.71.2**: Improved triangular workflow support
- **Automatic Resolution**: Respects `@{push}` configuration
- **Cross-Repository Operations**: `-R` flag for repository targeting

## 8. ISSUE TEMPLATE & STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION
