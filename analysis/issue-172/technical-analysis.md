### Technology Guidelines Loading

#### Agent System Architecture Guidelines
**Source:** `/workspace/worktrees/ai-code-forge/issue-172/templates/guidelines/claude-agents-guidelines.md`

**Key Implementation Principles:**
- **Context Window Decluttering (CRITICAL)**: Agent tasks MUST remove clutter from main context
- **Capability Uniqueness**: Each agent must provide distinct, non-overlapping value
- **Computational Tasks Focus**: Agents embody computational tasks, not human organizational roles
- **Context Boundary Management**: Clear input/output boundaries without main context dependency

**Date/Time Handling Requirements:**
- Environment context propagation MUST maintain information currency
- Agent outputs MUST be concise summaries - detailed work stays in agent context
- Current year extraction from environment date context is CRITICAL for web research

#### Environment Context Propagation Standards
**Source:** Researcher agent definition analysis

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Dynamic Currency Extraction**: 
   - MANDATORY parsing of environment "Today's date" field to extract current year
   - CRITICAL requirement: Extract current year from environment context before constructing search queries
   - All web research MUST include current year for information currency

2. **Environment Date Processing**:
   ```
   Environment format: "Today's date: YYYY-MM-DD"
   Required processing: Extract YYYY for dynamic search queries
   Usage pattern: "[technology] [current_year] documentation"
   ```

3. **Context Propagation Chain**:
   - Environment context → Agent context → Search queries
   - Date accuracy MUST be maintained throughout agent invocation chain
   - No hardcoded dates or assumptions about current year

#### Agent Reliability and Data Accuracy Standards

**Authority Ranking for Research Sources:**
- **Tier 1 (Highest)**: Official documentation, RFC specifications, security advisories
- **Tier 2 (High)**: Maintainer communications, official blogs, conference presentations
- **Tier 3 (Community)**: High-reputation discussions, peer-reviewed articles
- **Tier 4 (Supplementary)**: Tutorial content requiring validation

**Validation Protocol Requirements:**
- Cross-reference multiple authoritative sources
- Verify information currency within acceptable timeframe (<12mo)
- Source authority verification (Tier 1/2 preferred)
- Implementation feasibility confirmation

**Error Handling for Date Context:**
- **Web Unavailable Mode**: Document web tool unavailability, reduce confidence levels
- **Rate Limit Management**: Prioritize critical research, implement graceful degradation
- **Currency Verification**: Confirm research sources are current and actively maintained

## Issue-172 Specific Analysis

### Problem Identification
**Core Issue**: Researcher agent's date handling mechanism appears to be using incorrect or stale date information when constructing web search queries.

**Impact Assessment**:
- **High Priority**: Affects research currency and relevance
- **System-Wide Risk**: Date context propagation affects all web-first research protocols
- **Data Accuracy**: Compromises validation of current information vs outdated resources

### Technical Root Cause Analysis

**Environment Context Propagation Chain:**
1. **Environment Input**: `Today's date: 2025-08-13` (from system context)
2. **Agent Processing**: Must extract year (2025) dynamically
3. **Search Query Construction**: Include current year for currency
4. **Research Validation**: Ensure information recency

**Potential Failure Points:**
1. **Static Date Hardcoding**: Agent using hardcoded year instead of dynamic extraction
2. **Environment Parsing Failure**: Incorrect regex or parsing logic for date extraction
3. **Context Inheritance**: Date context not properly passed to sub-agent invocations
4. **Search Query Formation**: Current year not included in search terms

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Date/Time Handling Best Practices
**Based on Agent Architecture Guidelines:**

1. **Environment Date Extraction**:
   ```python
   # Required pattern for researcher agent
   import re
   from datetime import datetime
   
   def extract_current_year(env_context: str) -> str:
       """Extract current year from environment date context"""
       # Parse "Today's date: YYYY-MM-DD" format
       match = re.search(r"Today's date: (\d{4})-\d{2}-\d{2}", env_context)
       if match:
           return match.group(1)
       # Fallback to system date if parsing fails
       return str(datetime.now().year)
   ```

2. **Search Query Enhancement**:
   ```python
   # Example implementation for web research queries
   def construct_research_query(topic: str, current_year: str) -> str:
       """Construct web search query with current year for currency"""
       return f"{topic} {current_year} best practices"
   ```

3. **Validation Requirements**:
   - MANDATORY: Verify date extraction before web research
   - REQUIRED: Include current year in search terms for currency
   - ENFORCE: Cross-validate information publication dates

#### Agent Reliability Standards
**Based on Researcher Agent Definition:**

1. **Web-First Protocol Compliance**:
   - Extract current year BEFORE constructing any search queries
   - Include currency indicators in all web research
   - Document research timestamp and source authority

2. **Error Handling and Degradation**:
   - Implement fallback for environment date parsing failures
   - Rate limit management with priority queuing
   - Quality indicators for reduced confidence scenarios

3. **Context Boundary Management**:
   - Agent handles environment date extraction internally
   - Main context receives only synthesized research findings
   - No environment parsing artifacts in main conversation

### Validation Metrics

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Environment date parsing accuracy: 100%
- ✓ Search query currency inclusion: All web research queries
- ✓ Information recency validation: <12mo preferred, <3mo ideal
- ✓ Context window cleanliness: No parsing artifacts in main context

**Quality Assurance Checklist:**
- [ ] Dynamic year extraction from environment context
- [ ] Current year inclusion in web search queries
- [ ] Information currency verification in research output
- [ ] Fallback mechanism for date parsing failures
- [ ] Error logging for debugging date context issues

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority (Blocks research accuracy):**
1. Fix environment date extraction in researcher agent
2. Implement dynamic year inclusion in web search queries
3. Add validation for date context propagation

**Medium Priority (Enhances reliability):**
1. Implement fallback mechanisms for date parsing failures
2. Add error logging for date context debugging
3. Enhance research currency validation

**Low Priority (Future improvements):**
1. Optimize date context caching across agent invocations
2. Implement timezone handling for global deployment
3. Add historical date context for research versioning

## Technical Dependencies

**No Breaking Changes Required:**
- Environment context format remains unchanged
- Agent selection mechanism unaffected
- Web research protocol structure preserved

**Enhancement Requirements:**
- Researcher agent date extraction logic
- Search query construction enhancement
- Error handling and logging improvements

## Risk Assessment

**Implementation Risks:**
- **Low Risk**: Isolated to researcher agent date processing
- **Medium Risk**: Web research currency validation changes
- **High Risk**: Environment context format changes (NOT REQUIRED)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement with fallback to current behavior
- Test against existing environment context format
- Validate against existing web research workflows

## Conclusion

The researcher agent's date handling issue requires focused implementation of dynamic environment date extraction with proper error handling and validation. The fix aligns with existing agent architecture principles and requires no breaking changes to the system architecture.

**Actionable Outcome:**
Implement dynamic year extraction from environment context in researcher agent with proper search query enhancement and validation mechanisms to ensure research currency and accuracy.
