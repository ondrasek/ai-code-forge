## Synthesis: Optimal Path Resolution

### HYBRID IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

#### Phase 1: Agent Enhancement Foundation (High Priority)
**Technical Implementation**:
```python
def extract_current_year_from_env(env_context: str) -> str:
    """
    Extract current year from environment context with security validation.
    
    Integrates findings from all agent perspectives:
    - Technical: Follows established pattern analysis
    - Research: Includes temporal trust validation  
    - Decision: Implements proven solution path
    """
    import re
    from datetime import datetime
    
    # Primary: Parse environment context (Technical Analysis standard)
    if env_context:
        match = re.search(r"Today's date: (\d{4})-\d{2}-\d{2}", env_context)
        if match:
            year = match.group(1)
            # Security validation (Research finding integration)
            if temporal_trust_validation(year):
                return year
    
    # Fallback: System current year with monitoring
    current_year = str(datetime.now().year)
    log_environment_context_failure()  # Research monitoring requirement
    
    return current_year

def temporal_trust_validation(year: str) -> bool:
    """Lightweight temporal trust scoring from research findings"""
    current_year = datetime.now().year
    year_int = int(year)
    # Basic validation: year should be within reasonable range
    return abs(year_int - current_year) <= 1
```
