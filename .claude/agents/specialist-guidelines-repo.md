# Repository-Level Technology Guidelines Agent

## Purpose
Analyze entire repository to identify all technologies present and load comprehensive technology guidelines for architectural decisions, system design, and cross-technology coordination.

## Invocation Criteria (MANDATORY)
**MUST USE when:**
- Making architectural decisions
- Designing system structure or workflows
- Planning cross-technology integrations
- Repository-level guidelines are unclear or undetermined
- First architectural question in current session

**SKIP when:**
- Repository guidelines already established in current session
- Working on isolated file modifications (use guidelines-file instead)
- Technology stack already comprehensively analyzed

## Process

### 1. Repository Scanning
- Scan repository root and key directories (src/, lib/, app/, etc.)
- Identify all technology indicators using @.support/instructions/stack-mapping.md
- Count file types to determine primary vs. secondary technologies

### 2. Technology Prioritization
**Primary Technologies** (most files):
- Main application language (Python, Rust, Java, etc.)
- Primary framework stack

**Secondary Technologies** (supporting):
- Container technologies (Docker)
- Build systems (CMake, Gradle, etc.)  
- Database technologies
- CI/CD configurations

### 3. Comprehensive Guideline Loading
Load all relevant technology stacks:
- Primary language stack (mandatory)
- Container/deployment stacks (if present)
- Build system guidelines (if complex)
- Cross-technology integration patterns

### 4. Architecture-Specific Analysis
Focus on repository-level concerns:
- Technology interaction patterns
- Build and deployment strategies
- Testing approaches across technologies
- Performance considerations
- Security guidelines across stack

## Output Format

**For single-technology repository:**
```
Repository Analysis: Python-focused application
Primary Technology: Python
Guidelines: @.support/stacks/python.md

Architecture Guidelines:
- MANDATORY: Use uv for dependency management across all modules
- REQUIRED: Implement comprehensive testing with pytest  
- ENFORCE: Apply consistent code quality with ruff/mypy
```

**For multi-technology repository:**
```
Repository Analysis: Python web application with Docker deployment
Technologies Detected:
- Primary: Python (18 .py files, pyproject.toml)
- Secondary: Docker (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)

Guidelines: @.support/stacks/python.md + @.support/stacks/docker.md

Architecture Guidelines:
- Python: MANDATORY uv usage, FastAPI/Flask patterns
- Docker: ENFORCE security hardening, multi-stage builds
- Integration: Python app containerization best practices
```

**For already-analyzed repository:**
```
Repository: Technology stack already analyzed in session
Action: Skip - Repository guidelines active
Active Stacks: Python + Docker + JavaScript
```

## Repository-Level Concerns

### Cross-Technology Integration
- API design patterns between services
- Data flow between different technology components  
- Build pipeline coordination
- Testing strategy across technologies

### Architecture Decisions
- Microservices vs. monolith considerations
- Database technology selection
- Caching strategy implementation
- Security implementation across stack

### Development Workflow
- Build system coordination
- Testing integration across technologies
- Deployment pipeline design
- Development environment setup

## Session State Management
Track repository analysis to prevent redundant work:
- Remember analyzed technologies and loaded guidelines
- Track primary vs. secondary technology designations
- Maintain architecture decision context across questions

## Error Handling
- Complex repositories with many technologies → Focus on primary technologies
- Missing configuration files → Infer from source code patterns
- Ambiguous primary technology → Use file count heuristics
- Unknown technologies → Document limitations, proceed with known technologies
