Apply micro-improvements across codebases using BatchTool for efficiency.

## Improvements to Apply
- Fix typos in comments and strings
- Standardize variable naming (camelCase, snake_case)
- Remove trailing whitespace
- Update outdated comments
- Add missing punctuation in comments
- Fix inconsistent indentation
- Standardize quote usage (' vs ")

## Process
1. Scan for improvement opportunities
2. Group similar changes
3. Apply using BatchTool
4. Preserve code behavior - only cosmetic changes

Focus on high-frequency, low-risk improvements.
