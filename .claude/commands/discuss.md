# Discuss and Critically Analyze

Get critical analysis of your ideas and proposals.

## Purpose
Prevents costly mistakes by challenging assumptions, finding flaws, and suggesting better alternatives. This command activates the critic agent to provide honest, evidence-based pushback.

## Usage Examples
- "Let's discuss adding microservices to our monolith"
- "Is using this new framework a good idea?"
- "What about rewriting this in Rust?"
- "Should we implement our own authentication?"
- "I'm thinking of adding blockchain to our app"

## What to Expect
- Thorough criticism of the proposal
- Research-backed concerns and risks
- Simpler or better alternatives
- Questions that challenge your assumptions
- Honest assessment of downsides

The critic agent will actively look for reasons NOT to do what you're proposing, helping you make better decisions by understanding all the risks and alternatives.
