TRIGGER: critical analysis request, proposal evaluation, decision support
FOCUS: comprehensive multi-perspective analysis of ideas and proposals
SCOPE: architecture decisions, technology choices, implementation strategies

ENHANCED_ACTIONS:
1. coordinate enhanced parallel analysis clusters for comprehensive evaluation with universal agent integration:
   - **Alternative Generation Cluster**: explorer + constraints + patterns + researcher (generate alternatives, identify limitations, recognize patterns, research validation)
   - **Evidence Analysis Cluster**: researcher + hypothesis + context + time (evidence-based research, scenario modeling, system understanding, historical analysis)
   - **Critical Evaluation Cluster**: critic + principles + invariants + completer (critical evaluation, best practices validation, design integrity, completeness assessment)
   - **Resolution Framework Cluster**: resolver + axioms + connector + principles (conflict resolution, fundamental principles, cross-domain insights, design principles)
   - **Performance Impact Cluster**: performance + constraints + hypothesis + critic (performance implications, resource limitations, optimization theories, critical assessment)
2. synthesize findings into balanced decision framework with multi-agent validated risk-benefit analysis
3. provide structured recommendations with implementation considerations validated by completer + docs + testing agents

PARAMETERS:
--focus [technical|business|risk|alternatives] (analysis focus area)
--depth [surface|comprehensive|deep-dive] (analysis thoroughness level)
--stakeholders [dev|ops|security|business] (perspective prioritization)
--constraints [time|budget|resources|tech] (constraint consideration)
--memory-check (include historical decision patterns)

ENHANCED_AGENT_CLUSTERS:
Alternative Generation: explorer + constraints + patterns + researcher + guidelines-repo
Evidence Analysis: researcher + hypothesis + context + time + patterns
Critical Evaluation: critic + principles + invariants + completer + testing
Resolution Framework: resolver + axioms + connector + principles + constraints
Performance Impact: performance + constraints + hypothesis + critic + time
Documentation & Implementation: docs + completer + testing + guidelines-file
Coordination: All enhanced clusters execute in parallel for comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis

ENHANCED_OUTPUT:
- Multi-perspective analysis from enhanced specialized agent clusters with universal agent validation
- Alternative approaches with trade-off comparison researched by researcher + patterns + explorer agents
- Evidence-based risk assessment with confidence levels validated by critic + principles + hypothesis agents
- Structured decision framework with clear recommendations approved by resolver + completer + docs agents
- Implementation considerations and potential obstacles analyzed by constraints + testing + performance agents
- Memory-informed insights from similar historical decisions enhanced by time + context + researcher agents
- Comprehensive feasibility assessment validated by completer + invariants + testing agents

## Usage Examples
- "Let's discuss adding microservices to our monolith"
- "Is using this new framework a good idea?"
- "What about rewriting this in Rust?"
- "Should we implement our own authentication?"
- "I'm thinking of adding blockchain to our app"

## Analysis Framework

**Enhanced Multi-Cluster Coordination** ensures comprehensive coverage with universal agent integration:
- **Alternative Generation**: explorer identifies options, constraints maps limitations, patterns recognizes similarities, researcher validates alternatives
- **Evidence Analysis**: researcher provides data, hypothesis models scenarios, context adds system understanding, time provides historical perspective
- **Critical Evaluation**: critic challenges assumptions, principles validates approaches, invariants ensures design integrity, completer identifies gaps
- **Resolution**: resolver synthesizes findings, axioms grounds in fundamentals, connector provides cross-domain insights, principles ensures sound approach
- **Performance Impact**: performance analyzes implications, constraints identifies limitations, hypothesis tests scenarios, critic validates assessments

**Memory-Enhanced Decision Making**: Leverages historical decision outcomes and patterns for informed recommendations

## Memory Integration

**Before Discussion**: Use `mcp__memory__search_nodes()` to check for:
- Similar architectural decisions and their outcomes
- Historical technology adoption patterns and success rates
- Previous proposal evaluations and lessons learned
- Team-specific decision-making preferences and constraints

**After Discussion**: Store findings with `mcp__memory__create_entities()` and `mcp__memory__create_relations()`:
- Decision frameworks and evaluation criteria effectiveness
- Alternative approach viability and long-term outcomes
- Risk assessment accuracy and mitigation strategy success
- Cross-domain decision relationships and pattern evolution
