TRIGGER: critical analysis request, proposal evaluation, decision support
FOCUS: comprehensive multi-perspective analysis of ideas and proposals
SCOPE: architecture decisions, technology choices, implementation strategies

ACTIONS:
1. coordinate parallel analysis clusters for comprehensive evaluation:
   - **explorer + constraints**: generate alternatives and identify limitations
   - **researcher + hypothesis**: evidence-based research and scenario modeling
   - **critic + principles**: critical evaluation and best practices validation
   - **resolver + axioms**: conflict resolution and fundamental principle application
2. synthesize findings into balanced decision framework with risk-benefit analysis
3. provide structured recommendations with implementation considerations

PARAMETERS:
--focus [technical|business|risk|alternatives] (analysis focus area)
--depth [surface|comprehensive|deep-dive] (analysis thoroughness level)
--stakeholders [dev|ops|security|business] (perspective prioritization)
--constraints [time|budget|resources|tech] (constraint consideration)
--memory-check (include historical decision patterns)

AGENT_CLUSTERS:
Alternative Generation: explorer + constraints + guidelines-repo
Evidence Analysis: researcher + hypothesis + time
Critical Evaluation: critic + principles + invariants
Resolution Framework: resolver + axioms + connector
Coordination: All clusters execute in parallel for multi-dimensional analysis

OUTPUT:
- Multi-perspective analysis from specialized agent clusters
- Alternative approaches with trade-off comparison
- Evidence-based risk assessment with confidence levels
- Structured decision framework with clear recommendations
- Implementation considerations and potential obstacles
- Memory-informed insights from similar historical decisions

## Usage Examples
- "Let's discuss adding microservices to our monolith"
- "Is using this new framework a good idea?"
- "What about rewriting this in Rust?"
- "Should we implement our own authentication?"
- "I'm thinking of adding blockchain to our app"

## Analysis Framework

**Multi-Cluster Coordination** ensures comprehensive coverage:
- **Alternative Generation**: explorer identifies options, constraints maps limitations
- **Evidence Analysis**: researcher provides data, hypothesis models scenarios
- **Critical Evaluation**: critic challenges assumptions, principles validates approaches
- **Resolution**: resolver synthesizes findings, axioms grounds in fundamentals

**Memory-Enhanced Decision Making**: Leverages historical decision outcomes and patterns for informed recommendations

## Memory Integration

**Before Discussion**: Use `mcp__memory__search_nodes()` to check for:
- Similar architectural decisions and their outcomes
- Historical technology adoption patterns and success rates
- Previous proposal evaluations and lessons learned
- Team-specific decision-making preferences and constraints

**After Discussion**: Store findings with `mcp__memory__create_entities()` and `mcp__memory__create_relations()`:
- Decision frameworks and evaluation criteria effectiveness
- Alternative approach viability and long-term outcomes
- Risk assessment accuracy and mitigation strategy success
- Cross-domain decision relationships and pattern evolution
