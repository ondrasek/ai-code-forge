# Discussion and Analysis

Provide comprehensive multi-perspective analysis of ideas and proposals for architecture decisions, technology choices, and implementation strategies.

## Instructions

1. Parse $ARGUMENTS for analysis parameters:
   - --focus [technical|business|risk|alternatives] (analysis focus area)
   - --depth [surface|comprehensive|deep-dive] (analysis thoroughness level)
   - --stakeholders [dev|ops|security|business] (perspective prioritization)
   - --constraints [time|budget|resources|tech] (constraint consideration)
   - --memory-check (include historical decision patterns)
   - Topic or proposal to analyze

2. Execute enhanced parallel analysis clusters
1. coordinate enhanced parallel analysis clusters for comprehensive evaluation with universal agent integration:
   - **Alternative Generation Cluster**: specialist-options-analyzer + specialist-constraint-solver + foundation-patterns + foundation-research (generate alternatives, identify limitations, recognize patterns, research validation)
   - **Evidence Analysis Cluster**: foundation-research + specialist-options-analyzer + foundation-context (evidence-based research, scenario modeling, system understanding)
   - **Critical Evaluation Cluster**: foundation-criticism + foundation-principles + specialist-constraint-solver + specialist-code-cleaner (critical evaluation, best practices validation, design integrity, completeness assessment)
   - **Resolution Framework Cluster**: foundation-conflicts + foundation-principles + specialist-constraint-solver (conflict resolution, fundamental principles, design principles)
   - **Performance Impact Cluster**: specialist-performance-optimizer + specialist-constraint-solver + specialist-options-analyzer + foundation-criticism (performance implications, resource limitations, optimization theories, critical assessment)
2. synthesize findings into balanced decision framework with multi-agent validated risk-benefit analysis
3. provide structured recommendations with implementation considerations validated by specialist-code-cleaner + specialist-stack-advisor + specialist-test-strategist agents

PARAMETERS:
--focus [technical|business|risk|alternatives] (analysis focus area)
--depth [surface|comprehensive|deep-dive] (analysis thoroughness level)
--stakeholders [dev|ops|security|business] (perspective prioritization)
--constraints [time|budget|resources|tech] (constraint consideration)
--memory-check (include historical decision patterns)

- Comprehensive feasibility assessment validated by specialist-code-cleaner + specialist-constraint-solver + specialist-test-strategist agents

## Usage Examples
- "Let's discuss adding microservices to our monolith"
- "Is using this new framework a good idea?"
- "What about rewriting this in Rust?"
- "Should we implement our own authentication?"
- "I'm thinking of adding blockchain to our app"

## Analysis Framework

**Enhanced Multi-Cluster Coordination** ensures comprehensive coverage with universal agent integration:
- **Alternative Generation**: specialist-options-analyzer identifies options, specialist-constraint-solver maps limitations, foundation-patterns recognizes similarities, foundation-research validates alternatives
- **Evidence Analysis**: foundation-research provides data, specialist-options-analyzer models scenarios, foundation-context adds system understanding
- **Critical Evaluation**: foundation-criticism challenges assumptions, foundation-principles validates approaches, specialist-constraint-solver ensures design integrity, specialist-code-cleaner identifies gaps
- **Resolution**: foundation-conflicts synthesizes findings, foundation-principles grounds in fundamentals and ensures sound approach
- **Performance Impact**: specialist-performance-optimizer analyzes implications, specialist-constraint-solver identifies limitations, specialist-options-analyzer tests scenarios, foundation-criticism validates assessments

**Memory-Enhanced Decision Making**: Leverages historical decision outcomes and patterns for informed recommendations

## Memory Integration

**Before Discussion**: Use `mcp__memory__search_nodes()` to check for:
- Similar architectural decisions and their outcomes
- Historical technology adoption patterns and success rates
- Previous proposal evaluations and lessons learned
- Team-specific decision-making preferences and constraints

**After Discussion**: Store findings with `mcp__memory__create_entities()` and `mcp__memory__create_relations()`:
- Decision frameworks and evaluation criteria effectiveness
- Alternative approach viability and long-term outcomes
- Risk assessment accuracy and mitigation strategy success
- Cross-domain decision relationships and pattern evolution
