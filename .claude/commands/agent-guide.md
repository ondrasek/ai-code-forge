- **prompter**: AI agent prompt creation for user projects

### Technology Guidelines (Conditional)
- **guidelines-file**: Technology-specific guidance for file modifications
- **guidelines-repo**: Architecture decisions with stack context

## Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

### Security Assessment Workflow
**Trigger**: User mentions security review, vulnerabilities, compliance
```
vulnerability-scanner → researcher → patterns → threat-modeling → compliance-checker → critic
```

### Performance Optimization Workflow  
**Trigger**: User reports performance issues, slow code, optimization needs
```
performance → patterns → hypothesis → constraints → completer → critic
```

### Architecture Design Workflow
**Trigger**: User asks about system design, architecture decisions
```
explorer → constraints → principles → invariants → guidelines-repo → critic
```

### Quality Assurance Workflow
**Trigger**: User requests code review, quality improvement
```
patterns → principles → testing → security → performance → completer → whisper
```

### Debugging Investigation Workflow
**Trigger**: Strange behavior, unexpected results, "why does this happen"
```
hypothesis → researcher → patterns → context → critic
```

## Agent Selection by Task Type

### Understanding Systems
- **How does X work?** → context + patterns + researcher
- **Historical evolution** → time + patterns + context  
- **Architecture flow** → context + explorer + principles

### Finding Problems
- **Security issues** → vulnerability-scanner + threat-modeling + compliance-checker
- **Performance bottlenecks** → performance + patterns + hypothesis
- **Code quality** → patterns + principles + critic + whisper
- **Test gaps** → testing + patterns + completer

### Making Decisions  
- **Choose approach** → explorer + constraints + resolver + critic
- **Architecture design** → guidelines-repo + explorer + principles + invariants
- **Trade-off analysis** → constraints + resolver + critic

### Implementation Tasks
- **Complete features** → completer + patterns + testing + docs
- **Refactor code** → patterns + principles + whisper + critic
- **Add security** → vulnerability-scanner + threat-modeling + compliance-checker
- **Optimize performance** → performance + patterns + constraints

## Proactive Agent Usage Protocol

**Claude Code automatically invokes multiple agents based on context. Users don't need to explicitly request agents.**

### Automatic Agent Combinations
- **"This code looks messy"** → patterns + whisper + critic
- **"How should I structure this?"** → guidelines-repo + explorer + principles  
- **Error messages shown** → researcher + hypothesis + patterns
- **"Is this secure?"** → vulnerability-scanner + threat-modeling + compliance-checker
- **"Why is this slow?"** → performance + hypothesis + patterns

### Advanced Multi-Agent Workflows

**Security specialists demonstrate sophisticated coordination:**
- vulnerability-scanner coordinates with researcher (CVE intelligence), patterns (security anti-patterns), critic (risk validation)
- threat-modeling integrates with context (system boundaries), constraints (security limitations), axioms (security fundamentals)
- compliance-checker works with researcher (regulatory updates), patterns (compliance patterns), docs (policy documentation)

**Performance analysis follows systematic patterns:**
- performance agent coordinates with patterns (performance anti-patterns), hypothesis (bottleneck theories), constraints (resource limitations)
- Results validated through critic agent for comprehensive optimization strategies

**Testing strategy employs comprehensive coordination:**
- testing agent integrates with patterns (test patterns), completer (coverage gaps), performance (performance testing)
- Coordinates with security agents for security testing requirements
