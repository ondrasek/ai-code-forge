### Making Decisions  
- **Choose approach** → explorer + constraints + resolver + critic
- **Architecture design** → guidelines-repo + explorer + principles + invariants
- **Trade-off analysis** → constraints + resolver + critic

### Implementation Tasks
- **Complete features** → completer + patterns + testing + docs

## Proactive Agent Usage Protocol

**Claude Code automatically invokes enhanced multiple agent clusters based on context with universal agent integration. Users don't need to explicitly request agents - the system now provides comprehensive parallel analysis with researcher, critic, and principles agents integrated across all commands.**

### Automatic Agent Combinations
- **"This code looks messy"** → patterns + whisper + critic
- **"How should I structure this?"** → guidelines-repo + explorer + principles  
- **Error messages shown** → researcher + hypothesis + patterns
- **"Is this secure?"** → vulnerability-scanner + threat-modeling + compliance-checker
- **"Why is this slow?"** → performance + hypothesis + patterns

### Enhanced Advanced Multi-Agent Workflows

**Enhanced Security specialists demonstrate sophisticated coordination:**
- **Primary Security Analysis Cluster**: vulnerability-scanner + threat-modeling + compliance-checker + researcher (comprehensive security analysis with intelligence validation)
- **Threat Intelligence Cluster**: researcher + patterns + hypothesis + context + time (CVE intelligence, pattern recognition, threat modeling, system understanding, historical analysis)
- **Risk Assessment Cluster**: critic + completer + performance + time + resolver (risk validation, completeness assessment, performance impact, historical analysis, conflict resolution)

**Enhanced Performance analysis follows systematic patterns:**
- **Performance Analysis Cluster**: performance + hypothesis + patterns + critic + constraints (performance bottlenecks, optimization theories, pattern recognition, critical assessment, resource limitations)
- **Architecture Quality Cluster**: principles + invariants + axioms + completer + resolver (design principles, integrity validation, fundamental soundness, completeness assessment, conflict resolution)

**Enhanced Testing strategy employs comprehensive coordination:**
