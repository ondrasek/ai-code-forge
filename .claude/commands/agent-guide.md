# Agent Guide Command

Guide for using the specialized AI agents in this template. 

Note: Use the built-in `/agents` command to manage and configure agents. This guide explains when and how to use each agent effectively.

## Available Agents

### Pattern-Based Agents
- **context**: Deep understanding across entire codebases
- **patterns**: Identify patterns and anti-patterns at scale
- **explore**: Explore multiple solutions simultaneously
- **whisper**: Make thousands of micro-improvements
- **constraints**: Solve complex multi-dimensional constraints
- **time**: Analyze code evolution and predict future
- **connect**: Apply knowledge from unrelated domains
- **complete**: Ensure absolute completeness
- **hypothesis**: Scientific approach to understanding
- **meta**: Create code generators and DSLs

### First-Principles Agents
- **principles**: Enforce fundamental software principles
- **axioms**: Derive solutions from basic truths
- **invariants**: Make invalid states impossible

### Documentation
- **docsync**: Keep documentation synchronized with code

### Conflict Resolution
- **resolve**: Handle conflicts between patterns and principles

## Usage Examples

1. **Deep Analysis**: "Use the context agent to understand how authentication works across this codebase"

2. **Pattern Detection**: "Use the patterns agent to find code duplication we could abstract"

3. **Solution Exploration**: "Use the explore agent to find different ways to implement caching"

4. **Code Improvement**: "Use the whisper agent to clean up inconsistencies"

5. **Principle Check**: "Use the principles agent to verify our microservices follow data sovereignty"

6. **Conflict Resolution**: "Use the resolve agent when patterns and principles suggest different approaches"

## Agent Selection Guide

Choose agents based on the task:
- **Understanding code**: context, time, hypothesis
- **Finding problems**: patterns, principles, invariants, complete
- **Generating solutions**: explore, axioms, connect, meta
- **Improving code**: whisper, complete, constraints
- **Resolving dilemmas**: resolve

## Combining Agents

Agents work well together:
1. Use **patterns** to find issues, then **principles** to understand why they're problematic
2. Use **explore** to generate options, then **constraints** to pick the best
3. Use **hypothesis** to understand behavior, then **invariants** to prevent bugs
4. Use **time** to see evolution, then **meta** to create generators for patterns
