TRIGGER: technology stack overview, stack configuration analysis, technology guidance review
FOCUS: comprehensive technology stack configuration analysis and guidance effectiveness
SCOPE: all stack configurations in `.claude/stacks/` directory and related guidance systems

ACTIONS:
1. coordinate parallel stack analysis clusters:
   - **guidelines-repo + guidelines-file**: technology-specific guidance analysis and effectiveness
   - **patterns + context**: stack usage patterns and technology adoption analysis
   - **researcher + time**: technology ecosystem evolution and best practices research
   - **constraints + invariants**: technology limitation analysis and compatibility assessment
2. analyze stack configuration completeness and guidance effectiveness
3. provide comprehensive technology guidance overview with usage recommendations

PARAMETERS:
--stack [name] (analyze specific technology stack)
--usage-patterns (show stack selection and usage patterns)
--effectiveness (analyze guidance effectiveness and coverage gaps)
--recommendations (suggest stack improvements and additions)

AGENT_CLUSTERS:
Technology Guidance: guidelines-repo + guidelines-file + constraints
Usage Analysis: patterns + context + time
Research & Evolution: researcher + hypothesis + explorer
Validation: critic + completer + invariants
Coordination: All clusters provide multi-dimensional stack analysis

OUTPUT:
- Comprehensive stack configuration inventory with capability mapping
- Technology guidance effectiveness analysis and coverage assessment
- Stack usage patterns and selection optimization recommendations
- Technology ecosystem evolution insights and future considerations
- Stack improvement recommendations and gap identification

## Stack Analysis Framework

**Multi-Dimensional Stack Assessment**:
- **Coverage Analysis**: Technology support completeness and guidance depth
- **Usage Effectiveness**: Stack selection patterns and guidance utilization
- **Evolution Tracking**: Technology ecosystem changes and adaptation requirements
- **Integration Assessment**: Cross-stack compatibility and workflow integration
- **Quality Validation**: Guidance accuracy and best practices alignment

**Memory-Enhanced Technology Guidance**: Leverages historical technology adoption patterns and guidance effectiveness

## Memory Integration

**Before Stack Analysis**: Use `mcp__memory__search_nodes()` to check for:
- Historical technology adoption decisions and outcomes
- Stack guidance effectiveness patterns and user feedback
- Cross-project technology choice patterns and lessons learned
- Technology ecosystem evolution trends and adaptation strategies

**After Stack Analysis**: Store findings with `mcp__memory__create_entities()` and `mcp__memory__create_relations()`:
- Stack guidance effectiveness metrics and improvement opportunities
- Technology adoption pattern evolution and decision frameworks
- Cross-stack relationship patterns and integration strategies
- Technology ecosystem adaptation success rates and optimization approaches

## Stack Configuration Details

For each technology stack, provides comprehensive analysis of:
1. **Stack name and file location** - Complete configuration mapping
2. **Key tools and frameworks covered** - Technology ecosystem coverage assessment
3. **Main guidelines and restrictions** - Guidance effectiveness and limitation analysis
4. **Associated commands and workflows** - Integration pattern effectiveness
5. **Activation and usage optimization** - Selection algorithm effectiveness and usage patterns
6. **Cross-stack relationships** - Technology compatibility and workflow integration
7. **Evolution and maintenance** - Adaptation requirements and sustainability analysis

## Technology Guidance Integration

**Guidelines Agent Coordination**:
- **guidelines-repo**: Repository-level technology stack analysis and architecture guidance
- **guidelines-file**: File-level technology-specific guidance and implementation patterns
- **Conditional Activation**: Technology-specific guidance only when patterns are unclear

**Stack Detection Integration**: References @.support/instructions/stack-mapping.md for centralized technology detection and optimization
