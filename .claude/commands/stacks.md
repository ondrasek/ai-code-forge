TRIGGER: technology stack overview, stack configuration analysis, technology guidance review
FOCUS: comprehensive technology stack configuration analysis and guidance effectiveness
SCOPE: all stack configurations in `.support/stacks/` directory and related guidance systems

ENHANCED_ACTIONS:
1. coordinate enhanced parallel stack analysis clusters with universal agent integration:
   - **Technology Guidance Cluster**: guidelines-repo + guidelines-file + constraints + principles (technology guidance analysis, limitations, design principles)
   - **Usage Intelligence Cluster**: patterns + context + time + researcher (usage patterns, system understanding, historical analysis, research validation)
   - **Evolution Research Cluster**: researcher + hypothesis + explorer + axioms (ecosystem evolution, technology theories, alternative approaches, fundamental principles)
   - **Validation & Assessment Cluster**: critic + completer + invariants + performance (critical assessment, completeness validation, design integrity, performance implications)
   - **Integration Analysis Cluster**: connector + resolver + docs + testing (cross-domain insights, conflict resolution, documentation, implementation testing)

## Stack Analysis Framework

**Enhanced Multi-Dimensional Stack Assessment**:
- **Coverage Analysis**: Technology support completeness and guidance depth analyzed by completer + patterns + guidelines-repo agents
- **Usage Effectiveness**: Stack selection patterns and guidance utilization validated by patterns + context + researcher agents
- **Evolution Tracking**: Technology ecosystem changes and adaptation requirements researched by researcher + time + hypothesis agents
- **Integration Assessment**: Cross-stack compatibility and workflow integration evaluated by connector + resolver + constraints agents
- **Quality Validation**: Guidance accuracy and best practices alignment verified by critic + principles + invariants agents
- **Performance Impact**: Technology performance implications assessed by performance + constraints + testing agents
- **Strategic Alignment**: Stack strategy validation conducted by axioms + resolver + principles agents

**Enhanced Memory-Coordinated Technology Guidance**: Leverages historical technology adoption patterns and guidance effectiveness through time + researcher + context + patterns agents with strategic validation by resolver + critic + principles agents for comprehensive, evidence-based technology guidance strategy

## Memory Integration

**Before Stack Analysis**: Use `mcp__memory__search_nodes()` to check for:
- Historical technology adoption decisions and outcomes
- Stack guidance effectiveness patterns and user feedback
- Cross-project technology choice patterns and lessons learned
- Technology ecosystem evolution trends and adaptation strategies

**After Stack Analysis**: Store findings with `mcp__memory__create_entities()` and `mcp__memory__create_relations()`:
- Stack guidance effectiveness metrics and improvement opportunities
- Technology adoption pattern evolution and decision frameworks
- Cross-stack relationship patterns and integration strategies
- Technology ecosystem adaptation success rates and optimization approaches

## Stack Configuration Details

For each technology stack, provides comprehensive analysis of:
1. **Stack name and file location** - Complete configuration mapping
2. **Key tools and frameworks covered** - Technology ecosystem coverage assessment
3. **Main guidelines and restrictions** - Guidance effectiveness and limitation analysis
4. **Associated commands and workflows** - Integration pattern effectiveness
5. **Activation and usage optimization** - Selection algorithm effectiveness and usage patterns
6. **Cross-stack relationships** - Technology compatibility and workflow integration
7. **Evolution and maintenance** - Adaptation requirements and sustainability analysis

## Technology Guidance Integration

**Guidelines Agent Coordination**:
- **guidelines-repo**: Repository-level technology stack analysis and architecture guidance
- **guidelines-file**: File-level technology-specific guidance and implementation patterns
- **Conditional Activation**: Technology-specific guidance only when patterns are unclear

**Stack Detection Integration**: References @.support/instructions/stack-mapping.md for centralized technology detection and optimization
