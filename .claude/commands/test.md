# Test Command

Please help me with testing:

1. **Find and run existing tests**
   - Identify the test framework being used
   - Run all tests and report results
   - Focus on any failing tests

2. **Create new tests if needed**
   - Write tests for uncovered code
   - Add edge case tests
   - Ensure proper test isolation

3. **Test coverage**
   - Check current coverage levels
   - Identify areas needing more tests
   - Suggest improvements

4. **Test quality**
   - Review existing tests for effectiveness
   - Check for test duplication
   - Ensure tests are maintainable

Run the tests and provide a summary of results, including any failures or areas of concern.
