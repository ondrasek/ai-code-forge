# /agent-ecosystem-review

TRIGGER: analyze agent ecosystem, optimize agents, review agent efficiency
FOCUS: comprehensive agent ecosystem assessment and optimization
SCOPE: all agents in .claude/agents/ directory plus codebase analysis

ACTIONS:
1. invoke ecosystem-analyzer agent: orchestrate enhanced multi-agent ecosystem analysis with universal agent integration
2. coordinate enhanced parallel agent clusters for comprehensive assessment:
   - **Codebase Intelligence Cluster**: patterns + axioms + context + researcher (codebase characterization with research validation)
   - **Ecosystem Quality Cluster**: patterns + principles + critic + completer (current agent ecosystem review with completeness analysis)
   - **Strategic Analysis Cluster**: hypothesis + explorer + connector + researcher (gap analysis with research-backed opportunities)
   - **Validation & Synthesis Cluster**: resolver + critic + principles + invariants (conflict resolution with principle validation)
   - **Performance Assessment Cluster**: performance + time + constraints + critic (ecosystem performance analysis with critical assessment)
3. generate structured optimization proposal with prioritized recommendations validated by critic + principles agents
4. provide implementation roadmap approved by resolver + completer + docs agents

PARAMETERS:
--priority [critical|high|medium|low|all] (filter recommendations by priority)
--output [summary|detailed|roadmap] (output format, default: detailed)  
--dry-run (generate proposal without implementation suggestions)
--focus [gaps|redundancy|optimization|new-agents] (specific analysis focus)

ENHANCED_AGENT_DELEGATION:
Primary: ecosystem-analyzer (coordination and synthesis with universal agent support)
Codebase Intelligence: patterns, axioms, context, researcher
Ecosystem Quality: patterns, principles, critic, completer
Strategic Analysis: hypothesis, explorer, connector, researcher
Validation & Synthesis: resolver, critic, principles, invariants
Performance Assessment: performance, time, constraints, critic
Documentation: docs, completer, principles

ENHANCED_OUTPUT:
- Executive summary with alignment score and priority recommendations validated by critic + principles agents
- Detailed codebase profile and development patterns researched by researcher + patterns + context agents
- Current agent ecosystem assessment with usage patterns analyzed by patterns + completer + performance agents
- Prioritized optimization recommendations (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) validated by resolver + constraints + critic agents
- Implementation roadmap with phases and success metrics developed by time + completer + docs agents
- Comprehensive proposal ready for multi-agent validation (critic + principles + resolver) and user approval

EXAMPLE:
/agent-ecosystem-review --priority high --output detailed

ENHANCED_BEHAVIOR:
- Delegates ALL analysis to enhanced specialized agent clusters off-context with universal agent support
- Coordinates parallel agent execution for maximum efficiency with atomic task distribution
- Synthesizes findings into actionable optimization proposal validated by multiple agent perspectives
- Provides strategic overview without overwhelming detail, enhanced by researcher + critic + principles validation
- Creates comprehensive proposal suitable for multi-agent validation (critic + principles + resolver + completer) and informed user decision-making

## Memory Integration

**Before Ecosystem Analysis**: Use `mcp__memory__search_nodes()` to check for:
- Previous ecosystem optimization outcomes and effectiveness patterns
- Historical agent performance data and usage trends
- Successful agent combination patterns and coordination strategies
- Ecosystem evolution patterns and optimization impact metrics

**After Ecosystem Analysis**: Store findings with `mcp__memory__create_entities()` and `mcp__memory__create_relations()`:
- Ecosystem health metrics and optimization recommendation effectiveness
- Agent coordination pattern evolution and performance improvements
- Cross-agent relationship patterns and synergy identification
- Optimization outcome tracking and long-term ecosystem sustainability

INTEGRATION:
- Results inform agent creation/modification decisions with historical context
- Recommendations implemented via todo agent with memory-informed prioritization
- Updates CLAUDE.md and agent combination patterns based on proven effectiveness
- Tracks ecosystem evolution and optimization outcomes with persistent knowledge
- Leverages cross-project ecosystem patterns for optimization insights
