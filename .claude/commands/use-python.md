# Use Python Stack

Please reference the Python development guidelines located at `.claude/stacks/python.md` for this conversation. This file contains:

- Python project setup with uv
- Testing and code quality tools
- Common Python patterns and best practices
- Python-specific libraries and frameworks
- Debugging techniques
- Environment configuration

When working on Python code:
1. Always use uv for dependency management (never pip, poetry, or conda)
2. Follow the patterns and practices outlined in the Python stack guide
3. Use appropriate Python-specific agents (researcher for libraries, patterns for Pythonic code)
4. Keep documentation and type hints up to date

Please acknowledge that you'll follow the Python stack guidelines for this session.
